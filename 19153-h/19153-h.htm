  <br clear="all" />
<hr class="short" />

  <p>The earliest authentic account we can obtain of the birth of this
  learned and celebrated writer, is from the Register Book of Eton College,
  in which he is entered "of Chatham, in the county of Kent, of the age of
  twelve years, in 1730,"&mdash;consequently, born in 1718.</p>

  <p>Whence a difference has arisen between the dates in this entry, and
  the inscription on his monument, hereafter given, we are unable to
  explain.</p>

  <p>The two royal foundations of Eton, and King's College, Cambridge,
  justly boast of this great scholar and ornament of his age. He received
  his first rudiments at the village of Lullingstone, in Kent; and was
  admitted upon the foundation, at Eton College, on the 3d of August, 1730,
  where he was three years captain of the school, previous to his removal
  to Cambridge. He was elected from Eton to King's College in 1736; took
  the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1740; and proceeded Master in 1744.</p>

  <p>He attended the Duke of Marlborough, and his brother, Lord Charles
  Spencer, at Eton, as their private tutor, and proved a valuable
  acquisition to that illustrious house; and, what may be reckoned, at
  least equally fortunate, his lot fell among those who knew how to
  appreciate his worth, and were both able and willing to reward it. The
  Duke made him his private secretary, in which capacity he accompanied his
  Grace during his campaign on the continent, where he had the command of
  the British forces; and, when he was made Master-General of the Ordnance,
  he appointed Mr. Bryant to the office of Secretary, then about 1400l. per
  annum.</p>

  <p>His general habits, in his latter years, as is commonly the case with
  severe students, were sedentary; and, during the last ten years of his
  life, he had frequent pains in his chest, occasioned by so much
  application, and leaning against his table to write; but, in his younger
  days, spent at Eton, he excelled in various athletic exercises; and, by
  his skill in swimming, was the happy instrument in saving the life of the
  venerable Dr. Barnard, afterwards Provost of Eton College. The doctor
  gratefully acknowledged this essential service, by embracing the first
  opportunity which occurred, to present the nephew of his preserver with
  the living of Wootton Courtney, near Minehead, in Somerset; a
  presentation belonging to the Provost of Eton, in right of his
  office.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bryant was never married. He commonly rose at half past seven,
  shaved himself without a glass, was seldom a quarter of an hour in
  dressing, at nine rung for his breakfast, which was abstemious, and
  generally visited his friends at Eton and Windsor, between breakfast and
  dinner, which was formerly at two, but afterwards at four o'clock. He was
  particularly fond of dogs, and was known to have thirteen spaniels at one
  time: he once very narrowly escaped drowning, through his over eagerness
  in putting them into the water.</p>

  <p>Our author must be considered as highly distinguished, beyond the
  common lot of mortality, with the temporal blessings of comforts, honour,
  and long life. With respect to the first of these, he enjoyed health,
  peace, and competence; for, besides what he derived from his own family,
  the present Duke of Marlborough, after his father's death, settled an
  annuity on Mr. Bryant of 600 l. which he continued to receive from that
  noble family till his death.</p>

  <p>He was greatly honoured among his numerous, yet chosen friends and
  acquaintance; and his company courted by all the literary characters in
  his neighbourhood. His more particular intimates, in his own district,
  were Doctors Barford, Barnard, Glynn, and Heberden. The venerable Sir
  George Baker, he either saw or corresponded with every day; likewise with
  Dr. Hallam, the father of Eton school, who had given up the deanery of
  Bristol, because he chose to reside at Windsor. When he went into Kent,
  the friends he usually visited were the Reverend Archdeacon Law, Mr.
  Longley, Recorder of Rochester, and Dr. Dampier, afterwards Bishop of
  that diocese. Besides the pecuniary expression of esteem mentioned above,
  the Duke of Marlborough had two rooms kept for him at Blenheim, with his
  name inscribed over the doors; and he was the only person who was
  presented with the keys of that choice library. The humble retreat of the
  venerable sage was frequently visited by his Majesty; and thus he partook
  in the highest honours recorded of the philosophers and sages of
  antiquity. Thus loved and honoured, he attained to eighty-nine years of
  age, and died, at Cypenham, near Windsor, Nov. 13, 1804, of a
  mortification in his leg, originating in the seemingly slight
  circumstance of a rasure against a chair, in the act of reaching a book
  from a shelf.</p>

  <p>He had presented many of his most valuable books to the King in his
  life-time, and his editions by Caxton to the Marquis of Blandford: the
  remainder of this choice collection he bequeathed to the library of
  King's College, Cambridge, where he had received his education.</p>

  <p>He gave, by will, 2,000 l. to the society for propagating the gospel,
  and 1,000 l. to the superannuated collegers of Eton school, to be
  disposed of as the provost and fellows should think fit. Also, 500 l. to
  the parish of Farnham Royal. The poor of Cypenham and Chalvey were
  constant partakers of his bounty, which was of so extensive a nature,
  that he commissioned the neighbouring clergy to look out proper objects
  for his beneficence.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bryant's literary attainments were of a nature peculiar to
  himself; and, in point of classical erudition he was, perhaps, without an
  equal in the world. He had the very peculiar felicity of preserving his
  eminent superiority of talents to the end of a very long life; the whole
  of which was not only devoted to literature, but his studies were
  uniformly directed to the investigation of truth. The love of truth
  might, indeed, be considered as his grand characteristic, which he
  steadily pursued; and this is equally true as to his motive, whether he
  was found on the wrong or right side of the question. A few minutes
  before he expired, he declared to his nephew, and others in the room,
  that "all he had written was with a view to the promulgation of truth;
  and, that all he had contended for, he himself believed." By truth, we
  are to understand religious truth, his firm persuasion of the truth of
  Christianity; to the investigation and establishment of which he devoted
  his whole life. This was the central point, around which all his labours
  turned; the ultimate object at which they aimed.</p>

  <p>Such are the particulars we have been able to collect of this profound
  scholar and antiquary. But the life of a man of letters appears, and must
  be chiefly sought for in his works, of which we subjoin the following
  catalogue:</p>

  <p>The first work Mr. Bryant published was in 1767, intituled,
  "Observations and Inquiries relating to various Parts of antient History;
  containing Dissertations on the Wind Euroclydon, (see vol. v. p. 325.);
  and on the Island Melite, (see vol. v. p. 357.), together with an Account
  of Egypt in its most early State, (see vol. vi. p. 1.); and of the
  Shepherd Kings." (See vol. vi. p. 105.) This publication is calculated
  not only to throw light on the antient history of the kingdom of Egypt,
  but on the history also of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Babylonians,
  Edomites, and other nations. The account of the Shepherd Kings contains a
  statement of the time of their coming into Egypt; of the particular
  province they possessed, and, to which the Israelites afterwards
  succeeded. The treatise on the Euroclydon was designed to vindicate the
  common reading of Acts, xxvii. 14. in opposition to Bochart, Grotius, and
  Bentley, supported by the authority of the Alexandrine M.S. and the
  Vulgate, who thought EUROAQUILO more agreeable to the truth.</p>

  <p>His grand work, called, "A New System, or, an Analysis of Antient
  Mythology," was the next; "wherein an attempt is made to divest Tradition
  of Fable, and to reduce Truth to its original Purity." This was published
  in quarto, vol. i. and ii. in 1774, and vol. iii. in 1776.</p>

  <p>In 1775 he published "A Vindication of the Apamean Medal, (see vol. v.
  p. 287.) and of the Inscription <span title="NÔE" class="grk"
  >&#x39D;&#x3A9;&#x395;</span>; together with an Illustration of another
  Coin struck at the same Place in honour of the Emperor Severus." This
  appeared in the fourth volume of the Archæologia, and also as a separate
  quarto pamphlet.</p>

  <p>"An address to Dr. Priestley, on the Doctrine of Philosophical
  Necessity illustrated," 1780. A pamphlet, octavo.</p>

  <p>"Vindiciæ Flavianæ; or, a Vindication of the Testimony given by
  Josephus concerning our Saviour Jesus Christ." A pamphlet, octavo.
  1780.</p>

  <p>"Observations on the Poems of Thomas Rowley; in which the authenticity
  of these Poems is ascertained." Two duodecimo volumes, 1781. In this
  controversy Mr. Bryant engaged deeply and earnestly, and was assisted in
  it by the learned Dr. Glynn of King's College, Cambridge. Our author in
  this, as in his other controversial writings, was influenced by a spirit
  of sober inquiry, and a regard for truth. The leading object he had in
  view, in his Observations on the poems ascribed to Rowley, was to prove,
  by a variety of instances, that Chatterton could not be their author, as
  he appeared not to understand them himself. This plea appears specious,
  yet it is certain the learned author failed egregiously in his proofs,
  and this publication added little to the reputation he had already
  acquired. The best way of accounting for Mr. Bryant's risking his
  well-earned and high character in the literary world in this controversy,
  and for the eagerness with which he engaged in it, is from the turn of
  his studies. "He had," to borrow the words of Mr. Mason, "been much
  engaged in antiquities, and consequently had imbibed too much of the
  spirit of a protest antiquarian; now we know, from a thousand instances,
  that no set of men are more willingly duped than these, especially by any
  thing that comes to them under the fascinating form of a new
  discovery."</p>

  <p>"Collections on the Zingara, or Gypsey Language." Archæologia, vol.
  vii.</p>

  <p>"Gemmarum antiquarum Delectus ex præstantioribus desumptus in
  Dactylotheca Ducis Marlburiensis," Two vols, folio, 1783, &amp;c. This is
  the first volume of the Duke of Marlborough's splendid edition of his
  invaluable collection of Gems, and was translated into French by Dr.
  Maty. The second volume was done in Latin by Dr. Cole, prebendary of
  Westminster; the French by Mr. Dutens. The Gems are exquisitely engraved
  by Bartolozzi. This work was privately printed, and no more copies taken
  than were intended for the crowned heads of Europe, and a few of his
  Grace's private friends; after which the coppers for the plates were
  broken, and the manuscript for the letter-press carefully reduced to
  ashes.</p>

  <p>"A Treatise on the Authenticity of the Scriptures, and the Truth of
  the Christian Religion." Octavo, 1792.</p>

  <p>"Observations upon the Plagues inflicted upon the Egyptians; in which
  is shewn the Peculiarity of those Judgments, and their Correspondence
  with the Rites and Idolatry of that People; with a prefatory discourse
  concerning the Grecian colonies from Egypt." Octavo, 1794.</p>

  <p>The treatise on the authenticity of the Scriptures was published
  anonymously, and the whole of the profits arising from its sale given to
  the society for the Propagation of the Gospel. It contains a good general
  view of the leading arguments for Divine Revelation.</p>

  <p>"Observations upon a Treatise, intituled, Description of the Plain of
  Troy, by Mons Le Chevalier," Quarto, 1795.</p>

  <p>"A Dissertation concerning the War of Troy, and the Expedition of the
  Grecians, as described by Homer; shewing that no such Expedition was ever
  undertaken, and that no such City in Phrygia ever existed." Quarto, 1796.
  The appearance of this publication excited great surprise among the
  learned, and made few proselytes to the doctrine it inculcates; and even
  his high authority failed in overturning opinions so long maintained and
  established among historians, and supported by such extensive and clear
  evidence. He is a wise man indeed who knows where to stop. Mr. Bryant had
  wonderfully succeeded in his famous Mythology, in "divesting Tradition of
  Fable, and reducing Truth to its original Purity," and this seduced him,
  as his antiquarian pursuits had done before, in the case of Rowley, to
  proceed to unwarrantable lengths in the Dissertation on the War of Troy.
  It was remarked on by Mr. Falconer, and answered in a very rude way by
  Mr. Gilbert Wakefield in a letter to Mr. Bryant. J. B. S. Morrit, Esq. of
  Rokeby Park, near Greta-Bridge, undertook to vindicate Homer, in a style
  and with manners more worthy of the subject and of a gentleman, and was
  replied to by Mr. Bryant.</p>

  <p>"The Sentiments of Philo Judæus concerning the <span title="LOGOS" class="grk"
  >&#x39B;&#x39F;&#x393;&#x39F;&#x3A3;</span>, or Word of God; together
  with large Extracts from his Writings, compared with the Scriptures, on
  many other essential Doctrines of the Christian Religion." Octavo,
  1797.</p>

  <p>"Dissertations on Balaam, Sampson, and Jonah," also, "Observations on
  famous controverted Passages in Josephus and Justin Martyr," are
  extremely curious, and such perhaps as only he could have written.</p>

  <br clear="all" />

  <p>"The New System, or, an Analysis of Antient Mythology," here presented
  to the public, is a literary phenomenon, which will remain the admiration
  of scholars, as long as a curiosity after antiquity shall continue to be
  a prevailing passion among mankind. Its author was master of the
  profoundest erudition, and did not come behind the most distinguished
  names of the last century, for their attention to the minutest
  circumstance that might cast a ray of light upon the remotest ages.
  Nothing in the antient Greek and Roman literature, however recondite, or
  wherever dispersed, could escape his sagacity and patient investigation.
  But we are not to confine our admiration of the work before us to the
  deep erudition discoverable in it; this elaborate production is equally
  distinguished for its ingenuity and novelty. Departing with a boldness of
  genius from the systems of his predecessors in the same walks of
  literature, he delights by his ingenuity, while he astonishes by his
  courage, and surprises by his novelty. In the last point of view, this
  work is indeed singularly striking; it departs from the commonly-received
  systems, to a degree that has not only never been attempted, but not even
  thought of by any men of learning.</p>

  <p>The subject, here undertaken by Mr. Bryant was one of uncommon
  difficulty; one of the most abstruse and difficult which antiquity
  presents to us; the information to be obtained concerning it must be
  collected from a vast number of incidental passages, observations and
  assertions scattered through antient authors, who being themselves but
  imperfectly acquainted with their subject, it is next to impossible to
  reconcile. This, however, our author has attempted; and though, in doing
  this, the exuberances of fancy and imagination are conspicuous, and some
  may entertain doubts, concerning the solidity of some of his conjectures,
  yet, even such are forced to allow that many parts of the author's scheme
  are probable, and deserving the highest attention.</p>

  <p>His method of proceeding by etymology was not a little hazardous; men
  of the greatest abilities have often failed in the use of it, while those
  of weak judgment have, by their application of it, rendered it the source
  of the greatest absurdities, and almost led the unthinking to connect an
  idea of ridicule with the term itself. But the judicious use which Mr.
  Bryant could make of this science is apparent in every part of his work:
  he derives from it the greatest and only light which can be cast upon
  some of his inquiries, and that in a way that will draw the admiration of
  those who have a proper acquaintance with the subject; that is, such as
  have a knowledge of the Oriental languages sufficient to enable them to
  trace them through the Greek, Latin, and other tongues, as they relate to
  the names of things, which in almost every country carry evidence of
  their being derived from the East; from whence it is certain mankind
  themselves are derived. The sagacity and diligence with which our author
  has applied his helps obtained from the scattered passages of antient
  authors and etymology, have enabled him to clear up the history of the
  remotest ages, and to elucidate objects hitherto surrounded with darkness
  and error. Upon the whole, it will be allowed by all who are capable
  judges of the subject, that the plausibility of his hypothesis is
  frequently apparent, his scheme great, and his discoveries
  extraordinary.</p>

  <p>It is my purpose, in the ensuing work, to give an account of the first
  ages, and of the great events which happened in the infancy of the world.
  In consequence of this I shall lay before the reader what the Gentile
  writers have said upon this subject, collaterally with the accounts given
  by Moses, as long as I find him engaged in the general history of
  mankind. By these means I shall be able to bring surprising proofs of
  those great occurrences, which the sacred penman has recorded. And when
  his history becomes more limited, and is confined to a peculiar people,
  and a private dispensation, I shall proceed to shew what was subsequent
  to his account after the migration of families, and the dispersion from
  the plains of Shinar. When mankind were multiplied upon the earth, each
  great family had, by <a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>divine appointment, a particular
  place of destination, to which they retired. In this manner the first
  nations were constituted, and kingdoms founded. But great changes were
  soon effected, and colonies went abroad without any regard to their
  original place of allotment. New establishments were soon made, from
  whence ensued a mixture of people and languages. These are events of the
  highest consequence; of which we can receive no intelligence, but through
  the hands of the Gentile writers.</p>

  <p>It has been observed, by many of the learned, that some particular
  family betook themselves very early to different parts of the world, in
  all which they introduced their rites and religion, together with the
  customs of their country. They represent them as very knowing and
  enterprising; and with good reason. They were the first who ventured upon
  the seas, and undertook long voyages. They shewed their superiority and
  address in the numberless expeditions which they made, and the
  difficulties which they surmounted. Many have thought that they were
  colonies from Egypt, or from Phenicia, having a regard only to the
  settlements which they made in the west. But I shall shew hereafter, that
  colonies of the same people are to be found in the most extreme parts of
  the east; where we may observe the same rites and ceremonies, and the
  same traditional histories, as are to be met with in their other
  settlements. The country called Phenicia could not have sufficed for the
  effecting all that is attributed to these mighty adventurers. It is
  necessary for me to acquaint the Reader, that the wonderful people to
  whom I allude were the descendants of Chus, and called Cuthites and
  Cuseans. They stood their ground at the general migration of families;
  but were at last scattered over the face of the earth. They were the
  first apostates from the truth, yet great in worldly wisdom. They
  introduced, wherever they came, many useful arts, and were looked up to
  as a superior order of beings: hence they were styled Heroes, Dæmons,
  Heliadæ, Macarians. They were joined in their expeditions by other
  nations, especially by the collateral branches of their family, the
  Mizraim, Caphtorim, and the sons of Canaan. These were all of the line of
  Ham, who was held by his posterity in the highest veneration. They called
  him Amon: and having in process of time raised him to a divinity, they
  worshipped him as the Sun; and from this worship they were styled
  Amonians. This is an appellation which will continually occur in the
  course of this work; and I am authorised in the use of it from Plutarch,
  from whom we may infer, that it was not uncommon among the sons of Ham.
  He specifies particularly, in respect to the Egyptians, that when any two
  of that nation met, they used it as a term of honour in their<a
  name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> salutations, and
  called one another Amonians. This therefore will be the title by which I
  shall choose to distinguish the people of whom I treat, when I speak of
  them collectively; for under this denomination are included all of this
  family, whether they were Egyptians or Syrians, of Phenicia or of Canaan.
  They were a people who carefully preserved memorials of their ancestors,
  and of those great events which had preceded their dispersion. These were
  described in hieroglyphics upon pillars and obelisks: and when they
  arrived at the knowledge of letters, the same accounts were religiously
  maintained, both in their sacred archives, and popular records. It is
  mentioned of Sanchoniathon, the most antient of Gentile writers, that he
  obtained all his knowledge from some writings of the Amonians. <i>It was
  the good fortune of Sanchoniathon</i>, says <a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>Philo Biblius, <i>to light upon some
  antient</i> <i>Amonian records, which had been preserved in the innermost
  part of a temple, and known to very few. Upon this discovery he applied
  himself with great diligence to make himself master of the contents: and
  having, by divesting them of the fable and allegory with which they were
  obscured, obtained his purpose, he brought the whole to a
  conclusion</i>.</p>

  <p>I should be glad to give the Reader a still farther insight into the
  system which I am about to pursue. But such is the scope of my inquiries,
  and the purport of my determinations, as may possibly create in him some
  prejudice to my design; all which would be obviated were he to be
  carried, step by step, to the general view, and be made partially
  acquainted, according as the scene opened. What I have to exhibit is in
  great measure new; and I shall be obliged to run counter to many received
  opinions, which length of time, and general assent, have in a manner
  rendered sacred. What is truly alarming, I shall be found to differ, not
  only from some few historians, as is the case in common controversy, but
  in some degree from all; and this in respect to many of the most
  essential points, upon which historical precision has been thought to
  depend. My meaning is, that I must set aside many supposed facts which
  have never been controverted; and dispute many events which have not only
  been admitted as true, but have been looked up to as certain æras from
  whence other events were to be determined. All our knowledge of Gentile
  history must either come through the hands of the Grecians, or of the
  Romans, who copied from them. I shall therefore give a full account of
  the Helladian Greeks, as well as of the Iönim, or Ionians, in Asia: also
  of the Dorians, Leleges, and Pelasgi. What may appear very presumptuous,
  I shall deduce from their own histories many truths, with which they were
  totally unacquainted, and give to them an original, which they certainly
  did not know. They have bequeathed to us noble materials, of which it is
  time to make a serious use. It was their misfortune not to know the value
  of the data which they transmitted, nor the purport of their own
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>It will be one part of my labour to treat of the Phenicians, whose
  history has been much mistaken: also of the Scythians, whose original has
  been hitherto a secret. From such an elucidation many good consequences
  will, I hope, ensue; as the Phenicians and Scythians have hitherto
  afforded the usual place of retreat for ignorance to shelter itself. It
  will therefore be my endeavour to specify and distinguish the various
  people under these denominations, of whom writers have so generally, and
  indiscriminately, spoken. I shall say a great deal about the Ethiopians,
  as their history has never been completely given: also of the Indi, and
  Indo-Scythæ, who seem to have been little regarded. There will be an
  account exhibited of the Cimmerian, Hyperborean, and Amazonian nations,
  as well as of the people of Colchis; in which the religion, rites, and
  original of those nations will be pointed out. I know of no writer who
  has written at large of the Cyclopians. Yet their history is of great
  antiquity, and abounds with matter of consequence. I shall, therefore,
  treat of them very fully, and at the same time of the great works which
  they performed; and subjoin an account of the Lestrygons, Lamii, Sirens,
  as there is a close correspondence between them.</p>

  <p>As it will be my business to abridge history of every thing
  superfluous and foreign, I shall be obliged to set aside many antient
  law-givers, and princes, who were supposed to have formed republics, and
  to have founded kingdoms. I cannot acquiesce in the stale legends of
  Deucalion of Thessaly, of Inachus of Argos, and, Ægialeus of Sicyon; nor
  in the long line of princes who are derived from them. The supposed
  heroes of the first ages, in every country are equally fabulous. No such
  conquests were ever achieved as are ascribed to Osiris, Dionusus, and
  Sesostris. The histories of Hercules and Perseus are equally void of
  truth. I am convinced, and hope I shall satisfactorily prove, that Cadmus
  never brought letters to Greece; and that no such person existed as the
  Grecians have described. What I have said about Sesostris and Osiris,
  will be repeated about Ninus, and Semiramis, two personages, as ideal as
  the former. There never were such expeditions undertaken, nor conquests
  made, as are attributed to these princes: nor were any such empires
  constituted, as are supposed to have been established by them. I make as
  little account of the histories of Saturn, Janus, Pelops, Atlas,
  Dardanus, Minos of Crete, and Zoroaster of Bactria. Yet something
  mysterious, and of moment, is concealed under these various characters:
  and the investigation of this latent truth will be the principal part of
  my inquiry. In respect to Greece, I can afford credence to very few
  events, which were antecedent to the Olympiads. I cannot give the least
  assent to the story of Phryxus, and the golden fleece. It seems to me
  plain beyond doubt, that there were no such persons as the Grecian
  Argonauts: and that the expedition of Jason to Colchis was a fable.</p>

  <p>After having cleared my way, I shall proceed to the sources, from
  whence the Grecians drew. I shall give an account of the Titans, and
  Titanic war, with the history of the Cuthites and antient Babylonians.
  This will be accompanied with the Gentile history of the Deluge, the
  migration of mankind from Shinar, and the dispersion from Babel. The
  whole will be crowned with an account of antient Egypt; wherein many
  circumstances of high consequence in chronology will be stated. In the
  execution of the whole there will be brought many surprising proofs in
  confirmation of the Mosaic account: and it will be found, from repeated
  evidence, that every thing, which the divine historian has transmitted,
  is most assuredly true. And though the nations, who preserved memorials
  of the Deluge, have not perhaps stated accurately the time of that event;
  yet it will be found the grand epocha, to which they referred; the
  highest point to which they could ascend. This was esteemed the renewal
  of the world; the new birth of mankind; and the ultimate of Gentile
  history. Some traces may perhaps be discernable in their rites and
  mysteries of the antediluvian system: but those very few, and hardly
  perceptible. It has been thought, that the Chaldaic, and Egyptian
  accounts exceed not only the times of the Deluge, but the æra of the
  world: and Scaliger has accordingly carried the chronology of the latter
  beyond the term of his artificial<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> period. But upon inquiry we shall
  find the chronology of this people very different from the
  representations which have been given. This will be shewn by a plain and
  precise account, exhibited by the Egyptians themselves: yet overlooked
  and contradicted by the persons, through whose hands we receive it.
  Something of the same nature will be attempted in respect to Berosus; as
  well as to Abydenus, Polyhistor, and Appollodorus, who borrowed from him.
  Their histories contained matter of great moment: and will afford some
  wonderful discoveries. From their evidence, and from that which has
  preceded, we shall find, that the Deluge was the grand epocha of every
  antient kingdom. It is to be observed, that when colonies made anywhere a
  settlement, they ingrafted their antecedent history upon the subsequent
  events of the place. And as in those days they could carry up the
  genealogy of their princes to the very source of all, it will be found,
  under whatever title he may come, that the first king in every country
  was Noah. For as he was mentioned first in the genealogy of their
  princes, he was in aftertimes looked upon as a real monarch; and
  represented as a great traveller, a mighty conqueror, and sovereign of
  the whole earth. This circumstance will appear even in the annals of the
  Egyptians: and though their chronology has been supposed to have reached
  beyond that of any nation, yet it coincides very happily with the
  accounts given by Moses.</p>

  <p>In the prosecution of my system I shall not amuse the Reader with
  doubtful and solitary extracts; but collect all that can be obtained upon
  the subject, and shew the universal scope of writers. I shall endeavour
  particularly to compare sacred history with profane, and prove the
  general assent of mankind to the wonderful events recorded. My purpose is
  not to lay science in ruins; but instead of desolating to build up, and
  to rectify what time has impaired: to divest mythology of every foreign
  and unmeaning ornament, and to display the truth in its native
  simplicity: to shew, that all the rites and mysteries of the Gentiles
  were only so many memorials of their principal ancestors; and of the
  great occurrences to which they had been witnesses. Among these memorials
  the chief were the ruin of mankind by a flood; and the renewal of the
  world in one family. They had symbolical representations, by which these
  occurrences were commemorated: and the antient hymns in their temples
  were to the same purpose. They all related to the history of the first
  ages, and to the same events which are recorded by Moses.</p>

  <p>Before I can arrive at this essential part of my inquiries, I must
  give an account of the rites and customs of antient Hellas; and of those
  people which I term Amonians. This I must do in order to shew, from
  whence they came: and from what quarter their evidence is derived. A
  great deal will be said of their religion and rites: also of their
  towers, temples, and Puratheia, where their worship was performed. The
  mistakes likewise of the Greeks in respect to antient terms, which they
  strangely perverted, will be exhibited in many instances: and much true
  history will be ascertained from a detection of this peculiar
  misapplication. It is a circumstance of great consequence, to which
  little attention has been paid. Great light however will accrue from
  examining this abuse, and observing the particular mode of error: and the
  only way of obtaining an insight must be by an etymological process, and
  by recurring to the primitive language of the people, concerning whom we
  are treating. As the Amonians betook themselves to regions widely
  separated; we shall find in every place where they settled, the same
  worship and ceremonies, and the same history of their ancestors. There
  will also appear a great similitude in the names of their cities and
  temples: so that we may be assured, that the whole was the operation of
  one and the same people. The learned Bochart saw this; and taking for
  granted, that the people were Phenicians, he attempted to interpret these
  names by the Hebrew language; of which he supposed the Phenician to have
  been a dialect. His design was certainly very ingenious, and carried on
  with a wonderful display of learning. He failed however: and of the
  nature of his failure I shall be obliged to take notice. It appears to
  me, as far as my reading can afford me light, that most antient names,
  not only of places, but of persons, have a manifest analogy. There is
  likewise a great correspondence to be observed in terms of science; and
  in the titles, which were of old bestowed upon magistrates and rulers.
  The same observation may be extended even to plants, and minerals, as
  well as to animals; especially to those which were esteemed at all
  sacred. Their names seem to be composed of the same, or similar elements;
  and bear a manifest relation to the religion in use among the Amonians,
  and to the Deity which they adored. This deity was the Sun: and most of
  the antient names will be found to be an assemblage of titles, bestowed
  upon that luminary. Hence there will appear a manifest correspondence
  between them, which circumstance is quite foreign to the system of
  Bochart. His etymologies are destitute of this collateral evidence; and
  have not the least analogy to support them.</p>

  <p>In consequence of this I have ventured to give a list of some Amonian
  terms, which occur in the mythology of Greece, and in the histories of
  other nations. Most antient names seem to have been composed out of these
  elements: and into the same principles they may be again resolved by an
  easy, and fair evolution. I subjoin to these a short interpretation; and
  at the same time produce different examples of names and titles, which
  are thus compounded. From hence the Reader will see plainly my method of
  analysis, and the basis of my etymological inquiries.</p>

  <p>As my researches are upon subjects very remote, and the histories to
  which I appeal, various; and as the truth is in great measure to be
  obtained by deduction, I have been obliged to bring my authorities
  immediately under the eye of the Reader. He may from thence be a witness
  of the propriety of my appeal; and see that my inferences are true. This
  however will render my quotations very numerous, and may afford some
  matter of discouragement, as they are principally from the Greek authors.
  I have however in most places of consequence endeavoured to remedy this
  inconvenience, either by exhibiting previously the substance of what is
  quoted, or giving a subsequent translation. Better days may perhaps come;
  when the Greek language will be in greater repute, and its beauties more
  admired. As I am principally indebted to the Grecians for intelligence, I
  have in some respects adhered to their orthography, and have rendered
  antient terms as they were expressed by them. Indeed I do not see, why we
  should not render all names of Grecian original, as they were exhibited
  by that people, instead of taking our mode of pronunciation from the
  Romans. I scarce know any thing, which has been of greater detriment to
  antient history than the capriciousness of writers in never expressing
  foreign terms as they were rendered by the natives. I shall be found,
  however, to have not acted up uniformly to my principles, as I have only
  in some instances copied the Grecian orthography. I have ventured to
  abide by it merely in some particular terms, where I judged, that
  etymology would be concerned. For I was afraid, however just this method
  might appear, and warrantable, that it would seem too novel to be
  universally put in practice.</p>

  <p>My purpose has been throughout to give a new turn to antient history,
  and to place it upon a surer foundation. The mythology of Greece is a
  vast assemblage of obscure traditions, which have been transmitted from
  the earliest times. They were described in hieroglyphics, and have been
  veiled in allegory: and the same history is often renewed under a
  different system, and arrangement. A great part of this intelligence has
  been derived to us from the Poets; by which means it has been rendered
  still more extravagant, and strange. We find the whole, like a grotesque
  picture, blazoned high, and glaring with colours, and filled with groups
  of fantastic imagery, such as we see upon an Indian screen; where the eye
  is painfully amused; but whence little can be obtained, which is
  satisfactory, and of service. We must, however, make this distinction,
  that in the allegorical representations of Greece, there was always a
  covert meaning, though it may have escaped our discernment. In short, we
  must look upon antient mythology as being yet in a chaotic state, where
  the mind of man has been wearied with roaming over the crude consistence
  without ever finding out one spot where it could repose in safety. Hence
  has arisen the demand, <span title="pou stôi" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C5; &#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3B9;</span>, which has
  been repeated for ages. It is my hope, and my presumption, that such a
  place of appulse may be found, where we may take our stand, and from
  whence we may have a full view of the mighty expanse before us; from
  whence also we may descry the original design, and order, of all those
  objects, which by length of time, and their own remoteness, have been
  rendered so confused and uncertain.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<h4>TO THE</h4>

<h3>THIRD VOLUME OF THE QUARTO EDITION,</h3>

<h4>BEGINNING AT VOL. iv. PAGE 1. IN THIS EDITION.</h4>

  <p>Through the whole process of my inquiries, it has been my endeavour,
  from some plain and determinate principles, to open the way to many
  interesting truths. And as I have shewn the certainty of an universal
  Deluge from the evidences of most nations, to which we can gain access, I
  come now to give an history of the persons who survived that event; and
  of the families which were immediately descended from them. After having
  mentioned their residence in the region of Ararat, and their migration
  from it, I shall give an account of the roving of the Cuthites, and of
  their coming to the plains of Shinar, from whence they were at last
  expelled. To this are added observations upon the histories of Chaldea
  and Egypt; also of Hellas, and Ionia; and of every other country which
  was in any degree occupied by the sons of Chus. There have been men of
  learning who have denominated their works from the families, of which
  they treated; and have accordingly sent them into the world under the
  title of Phaleg, Japhet, and Javan. I might, in like manner, have
  prefixed to mine the name either of Cuth, or Cuthim; for, upon the
  history of this people my system chiefly turns. It may be asked, if there
  were no other great families upon earth, besides that of the Cuthites,
  worthy of record: if no other people ever performed great actions, and
  made themselves respectable to posterity. Such there possibly may have
  been; and the field is open to any who may choose to make inquiry. My
  taking this particular path does not in the least abridge others from
  prosecuting different views, wherever they may see an opening.</p>

  <p>As my researches are deep, and remote, I shall sometimes take the
  liberty of repeating what has preceded; that the truths which I maintain
  may more readily be perceived. We are oftentimes, by the importunity of a
  persevering writer, teazed into an unsatisfactory compliance, and yield a
  painful assent; but, upon closing the book, our scruples return, and we
  lapse at once into doubt and darkness. It has therefore been my rule to
  bring vouchers for every thing, which I maintain; and though I might upon
  the renewal of my argument refer to another volume, and a distant page,
  yet I many times choose to repeat my evidence, and bring it again under
  immediate inspection. And if I do not scruple labour and expense, I hope
  the reader will not be disgusted by this seeming redundancy in my
  arrangement. What I have now to present to the public, contains matter of
  great moment, and should I be found to be in the right, it will afford a
  sure basis for the future history of the world. None can well judge
  either of the labour, or utility of the work, but those who have been
  conversant in the writings of chronologers, and other learned men, upon
  these subjects, and seen the difficulties with which they were
  embarrassed. Great, undoubtedly, must have been the learning and
  perspicuity of a Petavius, Perizonius, Scaliger, Grotius, and Le Clerc;
  also of an Usher, Pearson, Marsham, and Newton. Yet it may possibly be
  found at the close, that a feeble arm has effected what those prodigies
  in science have overlooked.</p>

  <p>Many, who have finished their progress, and are determined in their
  principles, will not perhaps so readily be brought over to my opinion.
  But they who are beginning their studies, and passing through a process
  of Grecian literature, will find continual evidences arise; almost every
  step will afford fresh proofs in favour of my system. As the desolation
  of the world by a deluge, and the renewal of it in one person, are points
  in these days particularly controverted; many, who are enemies to
  Revelation, upon seeing these truths ascertained, may be led to a more
  intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures: and such an insight cannot but
  be productive of good. For our faith depends upon historical experience:
  and it is mere ignorance, that makes infidels. Hence it is possible, that
  some may be won over by historical evidence, whom a refined theological
  argument cannot reach. An illness, which some time ago confined me to my
  bed, and afterwards to my chamber, afforded me, during its recess, an
  opportunity of making some versions from the poets whom I quote, when I
  was little able to do any thing of more consequence. The translation from
  Dionysius was particularly done at that season, and will give the reader
  some faint idea of the original, and its beauties.</p>

  <p>I cannot conclude without acknowledging my obligations to a most
  worthy and learned<a name="footnotetag7"
  href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> friend for his zeal towards my work;
  and for his assistance both in this, and my former publication. I am
  indebted to him not only for his judicious remarks, but for his goodness
  in transcribing for me many of my dissertations, without which my
  progress would have been greatly retarded. His care likewise, and
  attention, in many other articles, afford instances of friendship which I
  shall ever gratefully remember.</p>

  <p>The materials, of which I purpose to make use in the following
  inquiries, are comparatively few, and will be contained within a small
  compass. They are such as are to be found in the composition of most
  names, which occur in antient mythology: whether they relate to Deities
  then reverenced; or to the places, where their worship was introduced.
  But they appear no where so plainly, as in the names of those places,
  which were situated in Babylonia and Egypt. From these parts they were,
  in process of time, transferred to countries far remote; beyond the
  Ganges eastward, and to the utmost bounds of the Mediterranean west;
  wherever the sons of Ham under their various denominations either settled
  or traded. For I have mentioned that this people were great adventurers;
  and began an extensive commerce in very early times. They got footing in
  many parts; where they founded cities, which were famous in their day.
  They likewise erected towers and temples: and upon headlands and
  promontories they raised pillars for sea-marks to direct them in their
  perilous expeditions. All these were denominated from circumstances, that
  had some reference to the religion, which this people professed; and to
  the ancestors, whence they sprung. The Deity, which they originally
  worshipped, was the Sun. But they soon conferred his titles upon some of
  their ancestors: whence arose a mixed worship. They particularly deified
  the great Patriarch, who was the head of their line; and worshipped him
  as the fountain of light: making the Sun only an emblem of his influence
  and power. They called him Bal, and Baal: and there were others of their
  ancestry joined with him, whom they styled the Baalim. Chus was one of
  these: and this idolatry began among his sons. In respect then to the
  names, which this people, in process of time, conferred either upon the
  Deities they worshipped, or upon the cities, which they founded; we shall
  find them to be generally made up of some original terms for a basis,
  such as Ham, Cham, and Chus: or else of the titles, with which those
  personages were, in process of time, honoured. These were Thoth, Men or
  Menes, Ab, El, Aur, Ait, Ees or Ish, On, Bel, Cohen, Keren, Ad, Adon, Ob,
  Oph, Apha, Uch, Melech, Anac, Sar, Sama, Samaïm. We must likewise take
  notice of those common names, by which places are distinguished, such as
  Kir, Caer, Kiriath, Carta, Air, Col, Cala, Beth, Ai, Ain, Caph, and
  Cephas. Lastly are to be inserted the particles Al and Pi; which were in
  use among the antient Egyptians.</p>

  <p>Of these terms I shall first treat; which I look upon as so many
  elements, whence most names in antient mythology have been compounded;
  and into which they may be easily resolved: and the history, with which
  they are attended, will, at all times, plainly point out, and warrant the
  etymology.</p>

<h4>HAM or CHAM.</h4>

  <p>The first of the terms here specified is Ham; at different times, and
  in different places, expressed Cham, Chom, <a name="footnotetag8"
  href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>Chamus. Many places were from him
  denominated Cham Ar, Cham Ur, Chomana, Comara, Camarina. Ham, by the
  Egyptians, was compounded Am-On, <span title="Amôn" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BC;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span> and <span title="Ammôn" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BC;&#x3BC;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>. He is to be found under this
  name among many nations in the east; which was by the Greeks expressed
  Amanus, and <a name="footnotetag9"
  href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>Omanus. Ham, and Cham are words,
  which imply heat, and the consequences of heat; and from them many words
  in other languages, such as <a name="footnotetag10"
  href="#footnote10"><sup>[10]</sup></a><span title="Kauma" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;</span> Caminus, Camera, were
  derived. Ham, as a Deity, was esteemed the <a name="footnotetag11"
  href="#footnote11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>Sun: and his priests were styled
  Chamin, Chaminim, and Chamerim. His name is often found compounded with
  other terms, as in Cham El, Cham Ees, Cam Ait: and was in this manner
  conferred both on persons and places. From hence Camillus, Camilla,
  Camella Sacra, Comates, Camisium, <a name="footnotetag12"
  href="#footnote12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>Camirus, Chemmis, with numberless
  other words, are derived. Chamma was the title of the hereditary <a
  name="footnotetag13" href="#footnote13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>priestess of
  Diana: and the Puratheia, where the rites of fire were carried on, were
  called Chamina, and Chaminim, whence came the Caminus of the Latines.
  They were sacred hearths, on which was preserved a perpetual fire in
  honour of Cham. The idols of the Sun called by the same <a
  name="footnotetag14" href="#footnote14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>name: for it
  is said of the good king Josiah, that <i>they brake down the altars of
  Baalim&mdash;in his presence; and the Chaminim</i> (or images of Cham)
  <i>that were on high above them, he cut down</i>. They were also styled
  Chamerim, as we learn from the prophet <a name="footnotetag15"
  href="#footnote15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>Zephaniah. Ham was esteemed the
  Zeus of Greece, and Jupiter of Latium. <a name="footnotetag16"
  href="#footnote16"><sup>[16]</sup></a><span title="Ammous, ho Zeus, Aristotelei." class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BC;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;, &#x1F41;

  &#x391;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;.</span>
  <a name="footnotetag17" href="#footnote17"><sup>[17]</sup></a><span

  &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD; &#x394;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;.</span> Plutarch says, that,
  of all the Egyptian names which seemed to have any correspondence with
  the Zeus of Greece, Amoun or Ammon was the most peculiar and adequate. He
  speaks of many people, who were of this opinion: <a name="footnotetag18"

  &#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;.</span> From Egypt his
  name and worship were brought into Greece; as indeed were the names of
  almost all the Deities there worshipped. <a name="footnotetag19"
  href="#footnote19"><sup>[19]</sup></a><span title="Schedon de kai panta ta ounomata tôn Theôn ex Aiguptou elêluthe es tên Hellada." class="grk"
  >&#x3A3;&#x3C7;&#x3B5;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD; &#x3B4;&#x3B5;

  &#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3BD; &#x1F19;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;.</span>
  <i>Almost all the names of the Gods in Greece were adventitious, having
  been brought thither from Egypt.</i></p>

<h4>CHUS.</h4>

  <p>Chus was rendered by the Greeks <span title="Chusos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Chusus; but, more commonly,
  <span title="Chrusos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>: and the places
  denominated from him were changed to <span title="Chruse" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B5;</span>, Chruse; and to Chrusopolis.
  His name was often compounded <a name="footnotetag20"
  href="#footnote20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>Chus-Or, rendered by the Greeks
  <span title="Chrusôr" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;</span>, Chrusor, and
  Chrusaor; which, among the Poets, became a favourite epithet, continually
  bestowed upon Apollo. Hence there were temples dedicated to him, called
  Chrusaoria. Chus, in the Babylonish dialect, seems to have been called
  Cuth; and many places, where his posterity settled, were styled <a
  name="footnotetag21" href="#footnote21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>Cutha,
  Cuthaia, Cutaia, Ceuta, Cotha, compounded <a name="footnotetag22"
  href="#footnote22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>Cothon. He was sometimes expressed
  Casus, Cessus, Casius; and was still farther diversified.</p>

  <p>Chus was the father of all those nations, styled <a
  name="footnotetag23" href="#footnote23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>Ethiopians,
  who were more truly called Cuthites and Cuseans. They were more in
  number, and far more widely extended, than has been imagined. The history
  of this family will be the principal part of my inquiry.</p>

<h4>CANAAN.</h4>

  <p>Canaan seems, by the Egyptians and Syrians, to have been pronounced
  Cnaan: which was by the Greeks rendered Cnas, and Cna. Thus we are told
  by Stephanus Byzantinus, that the antient name of Phenicia was Cna. <span
  title="Chna, houtos hê Phoinikê ekaleito. to ethnikon Chnaios." class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;, &#x1F41;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x1F21;
  &#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;
  &#x3B5;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;. &#x3C4;&#x3BF;
  &#x3B5;&#x3B8;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3A7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;.</span> The same is said by
  Philo Biblius, from Sanchoniathon. <a name="footnotetag24"
  href="#footnote24"><sup>[24]</sup></a><span title="Chna tou prôtou metonomasthentos Phoinikos." class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1; &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;
  &#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;
  &#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;.</span> And, in
  another place, he says, that Isiris, the same as Osiris, was the brother
  to Cna. <a name="footnotetag25"
  href="#footnote25"><sup>[25]</sup></a><span title="Isiris&mdash;adelphos Chna" class="grk"
  >&#x399;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;&mdash;&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x3A7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>; the purport of which is conformable to the
  account in the Scriptures, that the Egyptians were of a collateral line
  with the people of Canaan; or, that the father of the Mizräim and the
  Canaanites were brothers.</p>

<h4>MIZRAIM.</h4>

  <p>This person is looked upon as the father of the Egyptians: on which
  account one might expect to meet with many memorials concerning him: but
  his history is so veiled under allegory and titles, that no great light
  can be obtained. It is thought, by many learned men, that the term,
  Mizräim, is properly a plural; and that a people are by it signified,
  rather than a person. This people were the Egyptians: and the head of
  their family is imagined to have been, in the singular, Misor, or Metzor.
  It is certain that Egypt, by Stephanus Byzantinus, is, amongst other
  names, styled <span title="Muara" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3C5;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, which, undoubtedly, is a
  mistake for <span title="Musara" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, the land of Musar, or
  Mysar. It is, by <a name="footnotetag26"
  href="#footnote26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>Eusebius and Suidas, called
  Mestraia; by which is meant the land of Metzor, a different rendering of
  Mysor. Sanchoniathon alludes to this person under the name of <a
  name="footnotetag27" href="#footnote27"><sup>[27]</sup></a><span
  title="Misôr" class="grk">&#x39C;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;</span>,
  Misor; and joins him with Sydic: both which he makes the sons of the
  Shepherds Amunus and Magus. Amunus, I make no doubt, is Amun, or Ham, the
  real father of Misor, from whom the Mizräim are supposed to be descended.
  By Magus, probably, is meant Chus, the father of those worshippers of
  fire, the Magi: the father, also, of the genuine Scythæ, who were styled
  Magog. The Canaanites, likewise, were his offspring: and, among these,
  none were more distinguished than those of Said, or Sidon; which, I
  imagine, is alluded to under the name of Sydic. It must be confessed,
  that the author derives it from Sydic, justice: and, to say the truth, he
  has, out of antient terms, mixed so many feigned personages with those
  that are real, that it is not possible to arrive at the truth.</p>

<h4>NIMROD.</h4>

  <p>It is said of this person, by Moses, that he was the son of Cush. <a
  name="footnotetag28" href="#footnote28"><sup>[28]</sup></a><i>And Cush
  begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth: he was a mighty
  hunter before the Lord: wherefore <ins class="correction" title="'it it said' in original"
  >it is said</ins>, even as Nimrod, the mighty hunter before the Lord. And
  the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.</i> His history is plainly
  alluded to under the character of Alorus, the first king of <a
  name="footnotetag29" href="#footnote29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>Chaldea; but
  more frequently under the title of Orion. This personage is represented
  by Homer as of a gigantic make; and as being continually in pursuit of
  wild <a name="footnotetag30"
  href="#footnote30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>beasts. The Cuthite Colonies, which
  went westward, carried with them memorials of this their ancestor; and
  named many places from him: and in all such places there will be found
  some peculiar circumstances, which will point out the great hunter,
  alluded to in their name. The Grecians generally styled him <a
  name="footnotetag31" href="#footnote31"><sup>[31]</sup></a><span
  title="Nebrôd" class="grk"
  >&#x39D;&#x3B5;&#x3B2;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3B4;</span>, Nebrod: hence places
  called by his name are expressed Nebrod, Nebrodes, Nebrissa. In Sicily
  was a mountain Nebrodes, called by Strabo in the plural <a
  name="footnotetag32" href="#footnote32"><sup>[32]</sup></a><span
  title="ta Nebrôde orê" class="grk">&#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x39D;&#x3B5;&#x3B2;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;
  &#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;</span>. It was a famous place for hunting; and for
  that reason had been dedicated to Nimrod. The poet Gratius takes notice
  of its being stocked with wild beasts:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag33" href="#footnote33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>Cantatus Graiis Acragas, victæque fragosum</p>
      <p>Nebrodem liquere feræ.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And Solinus speaks to the same purpose: <a name="footnotetag34"
  href="#footnote34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>Nebrodem damæ et hinnuli
  pervagantur. At the foot of the mountain were the warm baths of
  Himera.</p>

  <p>The term <span title="Nebros" class="grk"
  >&#x39D;&#x3B5;&#x3B2;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Nebros, which was
  substituted by the Greeks for Nimrod, signifying a fawn, gave occasion to
  many allusions about a fawn, and fawn-skin, in the Dionusiaca, and other
  mysteries. There was a town Nebrissa, near the mouth of the Bætis in
  Spain, called, by Pliny, Veneria; <a name="footnotetag35"
  href="#footnote35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>Inter æstuaria Bætis oppidum
  Nebrissa, cognomine Veneria. This, I should think, was a mistake for
  Venaria; for there were places of that name. Here were preserved the same
  rites and memorials, as are mentioned above; wherein was no allusion to
  Venus, but to Nimrod and Bacchus. The island, and its rites, are
  mentioned by Silius Italicus.</p>

  <p>The history of Nimrod was, in great measure, lost in the superior
  reverence shewn to Chus, or Bacchus: yet, there is reason to think, that
  divine honours were of old paid to him. The family of the Nebridæ at <a
  name="footnotetag39" href="#footnote39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>Athens, and
  another of the same name at Cos, were, as we may infer from their
  history, the posterity of people, who had been priests to Nimrod. He
  seems to have been worshipped in Sicily under the names of Elorus,
  Belorus, and Orion. He was likewise styled <a name="footnotetag40"
  href="#footnote40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>Belus: but as this was merely a
  title, and conferred upon other persons, it renders his history very
  difficult to be distinguished.</p>

  <p>Aur, sometimes expressed Or, Ur, and Our, signifies both light and

  <i>The Phenicians and Syrians name Cronus Eel, and Beel, and
  Bolathes.</i> The Canaanitish term Elion is a compound of Eli On, both
  titles of the Sun: hence the former is often joined with Aur, and Orus.
  <a name="footnotetag51" href="#footnote51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>Elorus, and
  Alorus, were names both of persons and places. It is sometimes combined
  with Cham: whence we have Camillus, and Camulus: under which name the
  Deity of the Gentile world was in many places worshipped. Camulus and
  Camillus were in a manner antiquated among the Romans; but their worship
  was kept up in other countries. We find in Gruter an inscription <a
  name="footnotetag52" href="#footnote52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>DEO CAMULO:
  and another, CAMULO. SANCTO. FORTISSIMO. They were both the same Deity, a

  the same as Hermes. <a name="footnotetag53"
  href="#footnote53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>Tusci Camillum appellant Mercurium.
  And not only the Deity, but the minister and attendant had the same name:

  He supposes the name to have been given to Hermes, on account of the
  service and duty enjoined him. But there is nothing of this nature to be
  inferred from the terms. The Hermes of Egypt had nothing similar to his
  correspondent in Greece. Camillus was the name of the chief God, Cham-El,
  the same as Elion, <span title="ho hupsistos" class="grk">&#x1F41;
  &#x1F51;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. He was
  sometimes expressed Casmillus; but still referred to Hermes. <a

  The Deity El was particularly invoked by the eastern nations, when they
  made an attack in battle: at such time they used to cry out, El-El, and
  Al-Al. This Mahomet could not well bring his proselytes to leave off: and
  therefore changed it to Allah; which the Turks at this day make use of,
  when they shout in joining battle. It was, however, an idolatrous
  invocation, originally made to the God of war; and not unknown to the
  Greeks. Plutarch speaks of it as no uncommon exclamation; but makes the
  Deity feminine.</p>

  And the Coptic Pentateuch renders the city On by the city of the Sun.
  Hence it was, that Ham, who was worshipped as the Sun, got the name of
  Amon, and Ammon; and was styled Baal-Hamon. It is said of Solomon, that
  he <i>had a vineyard at <a name="footnotetag61"
  href="#footnote61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>Baal-Hamon;</i> a name probably
  given to the place by his Egyptian wife, the daughter of Pharaoh. The
  term El was combined in the same manner; and many places sacred to the
  Sun were styled El-on, as well as El-our. It was sometimes rendered
  Eleon; from whence came <span title="hêlios" class="grk"
  >&#x1F21;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, and <span title="hêlion" class="grk"
  >&#x1F21;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>. The Syrians, Cretans, and
  Canaanites, went farther, and made a combination of the terms Ab-El-Eon,
  Pater Summus Sol, or Pater Deus Sol; hence they formed Abellon, and
  Abelion before mentioned. Hesychius interprets <span title="Abelion, Hêlion; Abelion, Hêliakon." class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B2;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;,

  <p>Vossius thinks, and with good reason, that the Apollo of Greece and
  Rome was the same as the Abelion of the East. <a name="footnotetag62"

<h4>AIT.</h4>

  <p>Another title of Ham, or the Sun, was Ait, and Aith: a term, of which
  little notice has been taken; yet of great consequence in respect to
  etymology. It occurs continually in Egyptian names of places, as well as
  in the composition of those, which belong to Deities, and men. It relates
  to fire, light, and heat; and to the consequences of heat. We may, in
  some degree, learn its various and opposite significations when
  compounded, from antient words in the Greek language, which were derived
  from it. Several of these are enumerated in Hesychius. <span

  consecrated any thing to their Deity, or made it a symbol of any supposed

  as there was scarce any thing, but what was held sacred by them, and in
  this manner appropriated; it necessarily happened, that several objects
  had often the same reference, and were denominated alike. For, not only
  men took to themselves the sacred titles, but birds, beasts, fishes,
  reptiles, together with trees, plants, stones, drugs, and minerals, were
  supposed to be under some particular influence; and from thence received
  their names. And if they were not quite alike, they were, however, made
  up of elements very similar. Ham, as the Sun, was styled <a
  name="footnotetag66" href="#footnote66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>Ait; and

  may be esteemed what the Sun is in his system, the source of heat and
  life, affording the same animating principle. This word having these two
  senses was the reason why the Egyptians made a heart over a vase of
  burning incense, an emblem of their country. <a name="footnotetag70"

  stood at the upper point of Delta, and was particularly sacred to <span

  Ur, or Orus: and thence called Athur-ai, or the place of Athur. At the

  Aithraia, or the Island of Athyr; so called from the worship of the Sun:
  and Lemnos was denominated Aithalia, for the same reason, from Aith-El.
  It was particularly devoted to the God of fire; and is hence styled
  Vulcania by the Poet:</p>

  <p>Ethiopia itself was named both <a name="footnotetag80"
  href="#footnote80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>Aitheria, and Aeria, from Aur, and
  Athyr: and Lesbos, which had received a colony of Cuthites, was
  reciprocally styled <a name="footnotetag81"
  href="#footnote81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>Æthiope. The people of Canaan and
  Syria paid a great reverence to the memory of Ham: hence, we read of many
  places in those parts named Hamath, Amathus, Amathusia. One of the sons
  of Canaan seems to have been thus called: for it is said, that Canaan was
  the father of the <a name="footnotetag82"
  href="#footnote82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>Hamathite. A city of this name
  stood to the east of mount Libanus; whose natives were the Hamathites

  expressed <span title="Amathous" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>, of the same

  the father of Jezebel; and of <a name="footnotetag84"
  href="#footnote84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>Athaliah, who was her daughter. For
  Ath was an oriental term, which came from Babylonia and Chaldea to Egypt;
  and from thence to Syria and Canaan. Ovid, though his whole poem be a
  fable, yet copies the modes of those countries of which he treats. On
  this account, speaking of an Ethiopian, he introduces him by the name of
  Eth-Amon, but softened by him to Ethemon.</p>

<h4>AD.</h4>

  <p>Ad is a title which occurs very often in composition, as in Ad-Or,
  Ad-On; from whence was formed Adorus, Adon, and Adonis. It is sometimes
  found compounded with itself; and was thus made use of for a supreme
  title, with which both Deities and kings were honoured. We read of Hadad,
  king of <a name="footnotetag86"
  href="#footnote86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>Edom: and there was another of the
  same name at Damascus, whose son and successor was styled <a
  name="footnotetag87" href="#footnote87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>Benhadad.
  According to Nicolaus Damascenus, the kings of Syria, for nine
  generations, had the name of <a name="footnotetag88"
  href="#footnote88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>Adad. There-was a prince Hadadezer,
  son of Rehob, king of <a name="footnotetag89"
  href="#footnote89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>Zobah: and Hadoram, son of the king
  of <a name="footnotetag90" href="#footnote90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>Hamath.
  The God Rimmon was styled Adad: and mention is made by the Prophet of the
  mourning of Adad Rimmon in the valley of <a name="footnotetag91"
  href="#footnote91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>Megiddo. The feminine of it was
  Ada; of which title mention is made by Plutarch in speaking of a <a
  name="footnotetag92" href="#footnote92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>queen of
  Caria. It was a sacred title, and appropriated by the Babylonians to
  their chief <a name="footnotetag93"
  href="#footnote93"><sup>[93]</sup></a>Goddess. Among all the eastern
  nations Ad was a peculiar title, and was originally conferred upon the
  Sun: and, if we may credit Macrobius, it signified <i>One</i>, and was so
  interpreted by the Assyrians: <a name="footnotetag94"
  href="#footnote94"><sup>[94]</sup></a>Deo, quem summum maximumque
  venerantur, Adad nomen dederunt. Ejus nominis interpretatio significat
  unus. Hunc ergo ut potissimum adorant Deum.&mdash;Simulacrum Adad insigne
  cernitur radiis inclinatis. I suspect that Macrobius, in his
  representation, has mistaken the cardinal number for the ordinal; and
  that what he renders <i>one</i> should be <i>first</i>, or <i>chief</i>.
  We find that it was a sacred title; and, when single, it was conferred
  upon a Babylonish Deity: but, when repeated, it must denote greater
  excellence: for the Amonians generally formed their superlative by
  doubling the positive: thus Rab was great; Rabrab signified very great.
  It is, indeed, plain from the account, that it must have been a
  superlative; for he says it was designed to represent what was esteemed
  summum maximumque, the most eminent and great. I should, therefore, think
  that Adad, in its primitive sense, signified <span title="prôtos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, and <span
  title="prôteuôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>: and, in
  a secondary meaning, it denoted a chief, or prince. We may by these means
  rectify a mistake in Philo, who makes Sanchoniathon say, that Adodus of
  Phenicia was king of the country. He renders the name, Adodus: but we
  know, for certain, that it was expressed Adad, or Adadus, in Edom, Syria,
  and Canaan. He, moreover, makes him <span title="basileus Theôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;
  &#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, King of the Gods: but, it is plain,
  that the word Adad is a compound: and, as the two terms of which it is
  made up are precisely the same, there should be a reciprocal resemblance
  in the translation. If Ad be a chief, or king; Adad should be

  &#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span> was the
  true reading. In short, Ad, and Ada, signified <i>first</i>, <span
  title="prôtos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; and, in a more lax
  sense, a prince or ruler: Adad, therefore, which is a reiteration of this
  title, means <span title="prôtos tôn prôtôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;

  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>;
  and answers to the most High, or most Eminent.</p>

  <p>Ham was often styled Ad-Ham, or Adam contracted; which has been the
  cause of much mistake. There were many places <a name="footnotetag95"
  href="#footnote95"><sup>[95]</sup></a>named Adam, Adama, Adamah, Adamas,
  Adamana; which had no reference to the protoplast, but were, by the
  Amonians, denominated from the head of their family.</p>

<h4>EES and IS.</h4>

  <p>Ees, rendered As and Is, like <span lang="he" title="ASH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5E9;</bdo></span> of the Hebrews, related to light
  and fire; and was one of the titles of the Sun. It is sometimes
  compounded Ad-Ees, and Ad-Is; whence came the Hades of the Greeks, and
  Atis and Attis of the Asiatics; which were names of the same Deity, the
  Sun. Many places were hence denominated: particularly a city in Africa,
  mentioned by <a name="footnotetag96"
  href="#footnote96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>Polybius. There was a river <a
  name="footnotetag97" href="#footnote97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>Adesa, which
  passed by the city Choma in Asia minor. It was, moreover, the name of one
  of the chief and most antient cities in Syria, said to have been built by
  Nimrod. It was, undoubtedly, the work of some of his brotherhood, the
  sons of Chus, who introduced there the rites of fire, and the worship of
  the Sun; whence it was styled Adesa, rendered by the Greeks Edessa. One
  of the names of fire, among those in the East, who worship it, is <a
  name="footnotetag98" href="#footnote98"><sup>[98]</sup></a>Atesh at this
  day. The term <i>As</i>, like Adad, before mentioned, is sometimes
  compounded with itself, and rendered Asas, and Azaz; by the Greeks
  expressed <span title="Azazos" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B6;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> and <a
  name="footnotetag99" href="#footnote99"><sup>[99]</sup></a><span
  title="Azizos" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B6;&#x3B9;&#x3B6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. In the very place
  spoken of above, the Deity was worshipped under the name of Azizus. The
  Emperor Julian acquaints us, in his hymn to the <a name="footnotetag100"
  href="#footnote100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>Sun, that the people of Edessa
  possessed a region, which, from time immemorial, had been sacred to that
  luminary: that there were two subordinate Deities, Monimus and Azizus,
  who were esteemed coadjutors, and assessors to the chief God. He supposes
  them to have been the same as Mars and Mercury: but herein this zealous
  emperor failed; and did not understand the theology which he was
  recommending. Monimus and Azizus were both names of the same God, the
  Deity of Edessa, and <a name="footnotetag101"
  href="#footnote101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>Syria. The former is,
  undoubtedly, a translation of Adad, which signifies <span title="monas" class="grk"
  >&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>, or <a name="footnotetag102"
  href="#footnote102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>unitas: though, as I have before
  shewn, more properly primus. Azizus is a reduplication of a like term,
  being compounded with itself; and was of the same purport as Ades, or Ad
  Ees, from whence the place was named. It was a title not unknown in
  Greece: for Ceres was, of old, called Azazia; by the Ionians, Azesia.
  Hesychius observes, <span title="Azêsia, hê Dêmêtêr." class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B6;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;, &#x1F21;
  &#x394;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;.</span> Proserpine,
  also, had this name. In the same author we learn that <span title="aza" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3B1;</span>, aza, signified <span title="asbolos" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, or sun-burnt:
  which shews plainly to what the primitive word <a name="footnotetag103"
  href="#footnote103"><sup>[103]</sup></a>related. This word is often found
  combined with Or; as in Asorus, and Esorus, under which titles the Deity
  was worshipped in <a name="footnotetag104"
  href="#footnote104"><sup>[104]</sup></a>Syria, <a name="footnotetag105"
  href="#footnote105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>Sicily, and Carthage: of the last
  city he was supposed to have been the founder. It is often compounded
  with El and Il; and many places were from thence denominated Alesia,
  Elysa, Eleusa, Halesus, Elysus, Eleusis, by apocope Las, Lasa, Læsa,
  Lasaia; also, Lissa, Lissus, Lissia. Sometimes we meet with these terms
  reversed; and, instead of El Ees, they are rendered Ees El: hence we have
  places named Azilis, Azila, Asyla, contracted Zelis, Zela, Zeleia,
  Zelitis; also Sele, Sela, Sala, Salis, Sillas, Silis, Soli. All these
  places were founded or denominated by people of the Amonian worship: and
  we may always, upon inquiry, perceive something very peculiar in their
  history and situation. They were particularly devoted to the worship of
  the Sun; and they were generally situated near hot springs, or else upon
  foul and fetid lakes, and pools of bitumen. It is, also, not uncommon to
  find near them mines of salt and nitre; and caverns sending forth
  pestilential exhalations. The Elysian plain, near the Catacombs in Egypt,
  stood upon the foul Charonian canal; which was so noisome, that every
  fetid ditch and cavern was from it called Charonian. Asia Proper
  comprehended little more than Phrygia, and a part of Lydia; and was
  bounded by the river Halys. It was of a most inflammable soil; and there
  were many fiery eruptions about Caroura, and in Hyrcania, which latter
  was styled by the Greeks <span title="kekaumenê" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>.
  Hence, doubtless, the region had the name of <a name="footnotetag106"
  href="#footnote106"><sup>[106]</sup></a>Asia, or the land of fire. One of
  its most antient cities, and most reverenced, was Hierapolis, famous for
  its hot <a name="footnotetag107"
  href="#footnote107"><sup>[107]</sup></a>fountains. Here was also a sacred
  cavern, styled by <a name="footnotetag108"
  href="#footnote108"><sup>[108]</sup></a>Strabo Plutonium, and Charonium;
  which sent up pestilential effluvia. Photius, in the life of Isidorus,
  acquaints us, that it was the temple of Apollo at Hierapolis, within
  whose precincts these deadly vapours arose. <a name="footnotetag109"

  He speaks of this cavity as being immediately under the edifice. Four
  caverns of this sort, and styled Charonian, are mentioned by <a
  name="footnotetag110" href="#footnote110"><sup>[110]</sup></a>Strabo in
  this part of the world. Pliny, speaking of some Charonian hollows in
  Italy, says, that the exhalations were insupportable. <a
  name="footnotetag111" href="#footnote111"><sup>[111]</sup></a>Spiracula
  vocant, alii <i>Charoneas</i> scrobes, mortiferum spiritum exhalantes. It
  may appear wonderful; but the Amonians were determined in the situation
  both of their cities and temples by these strange phænomena. They
  esteemed no places so sacred as those where there were fiery eruptions,
  uncommon steams, and sulphureous exhalations. In Armenia, near <a
  name="footnotetag112" href="#footnote112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>Comana, and
  Camisena, was the temple of <a name="footnotetag113"
  href="#footnote113"><sup>[113]</sup></a>Anait, or fountain of the Sun. It
  was a Persic and Babylonish Deity, as well as an Armenian, which was
  honoured with Puratheia, where the rites of fire were particularly kept
  up. The city itself was named Zela; and close behind it was a large
  nitrous lake. In short, from the Amonian terms, Al-As, came the Grecian
  <span title="halos, halas, hals" class="grk"
  >&#x1F01;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;, &#x1F01;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;,
  &#x1F01;&#x3BB;&#x3C2;</span>; as, from the same terms reversed (As-El),
  were formed the Latine Sal, Sol, and Salum. Wherever the Amonians found
  places with these natural or præternatural properties, they held them
  sacred, and founded their temples near them. <a name="footnotetag114"
  href="#footnote114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>Selenousia, in Ionia, was upon a
  salt lake, sacred to Artemis. In Epirus was a city called Alesa, Elissa,
  and Lesa: and hard by were the Alesian plains; similar to the Elysian in
  Egypt: in these was produced a great quantity of fossil <a
  name="footnotetag115" href="#footnote115"><sup>[115]</sup></a>salt. There
  was an Alesia in Arcadia, and a mountain Alesium with a temple upon it.
  Here an antient personage, Æputus, was said to have been suffocated with
  salt water: in which history there is an allusion to the etymology of the
  name. It is true that Pausanias supposes it to have been called Alesia,
  from Rhea having wandered thither; <a name="footnotetag116"
  href="#footnote116"><sup>[116]</sup></a><span title="dia tên alên, hôs phasi, kaloumenon tên Rheas" class="grk"

  &#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3BD; &#x1FEC;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>: but it was
  not <span title="alê" class="grk">&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;</span>, but <span
  title="halas" class="grk">&#x1F01;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>, and <span
  title="halos" class="grk">&#x1F01;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, sal; and
  the Deity, to whom that body was sacred, from whence the place was named.
  And this is certain from another tradition, which there prevailed: for it
  is said that in antient times there was an eruption of sea water in the
  temple: <a name="footnotetag117"
  href="#footnote117"><sup>[117]</sup></a><span title="Thalassês de anaphainesthai kuma en tôi Hierôi toutôi logos estin archaios." class="grk"

  &#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C7;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;.</span> Nor was this
  appellation confined to one particular sort of fountain, or water: but
  all waters, that had any uncommon property, were in like manner sacred to
  Elees, or Eesel. It was an antient title of Mithras and Osiris in the
  east, the same as <a name="footnotetag118"
  href="#footnote118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>Sol, the Sun. From hence the
  priests of the Sun were called Soli and Solimi in Cilicia, Selli in
  Epirus, Salii at Rome, all originally priests of fire. As such they are
  described by Virgil:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Tum Salii ad cantus incensa altaria circum.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In like manner the Silaceni of the Babylonians were worshippers of the
  same Deity, and given to the rites of fire, which accompanied the worship
  of the Sun.</p>

  <p>The chief city of Silacena was Sile or Sele, where were eruptions of
  fire. Sele is the place or city of the Sun. Whenever therefore Sal, or
  Sel, or the same reversed, occur in the composition of any place's name,
  we may be pretty certain that the place is remarkable either for its
  rites or situation, and attended with some of the circumstances <a
  name="footnotetag119"
  href="#footnote119"><sup>[119]</sup></a>above-mentioned. Many instances
  may be produced of those denominated from the quality of their waters. In
  the river <a name="footnotetag120"
  href="#footnote120"><sup>[120]</sup></a>Silarus of Italy every thing
  became petrified. The river <a name="footnotetag121"
  href="#footnote121"><sup>[121]</sup></a>Silias in India would suffer
  nothing to swim. The waters of the <a name="footnotetag122"
  href="#footnote122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>Salassi in the Alps were of great
  use in refining gold. The fountain at <a name="footnotetag123"
  href="#footnote123"><sup>[123]</sup></a>Selinus in Sicily was of a bitter
  saline taste. Of the salt lake near <a name="footnotetag124"
  href="#footnote124"><sup>[124]</sup></a>Selinousia in Ionia I have
  spoken. The fountain Siloë at Jerusalem was in some degree <a
  name="footnotetag125" href="#footnote125"><sup>[125]</sup></a>salt. Ovid
  mentions Sulmo, where he was born, as noted for its <a
  name="footnotetag126" href="#footnote126"><sup>[126]</sup></a>cool
  waters: for cold streams were equally sacred to the Sun as those, which
  were of a contrary nature. The fine waters at Ænon, where John baptized,
  were called <a name="footnotetag127"
  href="#footnote127"><sup>[127]</sup></a>Salim. The river Ales near
  Colophon ran through the grove of Apollo, and was esteemed the coldest
  stream in Ionia. <a name="footnotetag128"

  Hameles, and Hamelas; contracted to Meles and Melas. A river of this name
  watered the region of Pamphylia, and was noted for a most cold and pure
  <a name="footnotetag130" href="#footnote130"><sup>[130]</sup></a>water.

  <p>It is wonderful, how far the Amonian religion and customs were carried
  in the first ages. The antient Germans, and Scandinavians, were led by
  the same principles; and founded their temples in situations of the same
  nature, as those were, which have been above described. Above all others
  they chose those places, where were any nitrous, or saline waters. <a

  >&#x396;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>. Hesychius tells us, that the Sun

  >&#x3A3;&#x3B1;&#x3C9;&#x3C2;</span> by the Babylonians. It is to be

  Adonis, or the Sun. Hesychius says, <span title="Zauanas, theos tis en Sidôni." class="grk"
  >&#x396;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;,

  &#x3A3;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;.</span> Who the Deity was, I
  think may be plainly seen. It is mentioned by the same writer, that the
  Indian Hercules, by which is always meant the chief Deity, was styled
  Dorsanes: <span title="Dorsanês ho Hêraklês par' Indois." class="grk"
  >&#x394;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3C3;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C2; &#x1F41;

  &#x399;&#x3BD;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;.</span> The name Dorsanes is
  an abridgment of Ador-San, or Ador-Sanes, that is Ador-Sol, <i>the lord
  of light</i>. It was a title conferred upon Ham; and also upon others of
  his family; whom I have before mentioned to have been collectively called
  the Baalim. Analogous to this they were likewise called the Zaanim, and
  Zaananim: and a temple was erected to them by the antient Canaanites,
  which was from them named <a name="footnotetag137"
  href="#footnote137"><sup>[137]</sup></a>Beth-Zaananim. There was also a
  place called Sanim in the same country, rendered Sonam<a
  name="footnotetag138" href="#footnote138"><sup>[138]</sup></a>, <span
  title="Sônam" class="grk">&#x3A3;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;</span>, by
  Eusebius; which was undoubtedly named in honour of the same persons: for
  their posterity looked up to them, as the Heliadæ, or descendants of the
  Sun, and denominated them from that luminary. According to Hesychius it
  was a title, of old not unknown in Greece; where princes and rulers were
  styled Zanides, <span title="Zanides, Hêgemones." class="grk"
  >&#x396;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;,
  &#x1F29;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;.</span> In <a
  name="footnotetag139" href="#footnote139"><sup>[139]</sup></a>Diodorus
  Siculus mention is made of an antient king of Armenia, called Barsanes;
  which signifies the offspring of the Sun. We find temples erected to the
  Deity of the same purport; and styled in the singular Beth-San: by which
  is meant the temple of the Sun. Two places occur in Scripture of this
  name: the one in the tribe of Manasseh: the other in the land of the
  Philistines. The latter seems to have been a city; and also a temple,
  where the body of Saul was exposed after his defeat upon mount Gilboa.
  For it is said, that the Philistines <a name="footnotetag140"
  href="#footnote140"><sup>[140]</sup></a><i>cut off his head, and stripped
  off his armour&mdash;and they put his armour in the house of Ashtoreth,
  and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethsan</i>. They seem to have
  sometimes used this term with a reduplication: for we read of a city in
  Canaan called <a name="footnotetag141"
  href="#footnote141"><sup>[141]</sup></a>Sansanah; by which is signified a
  place sacred to the most illustrious Orb of day. Some antient statues
  near mount Cronius in Elis were by the natives called Zanes, as we are
  told by Pausanias: <a name="footnotetag142"
  href="#footnote142"><sup>[142]</sup></a><span title="Kalountai de hupo tôn epichôriôn Zanes." class="grk"

  been the statues of Zeus: but Zan was more properly the Sun; and they
  were the statues of persons, who were denominated from him. One of these
  persons, styled Zanes, and Zanim, was Chus: whose posterity sent out
  large colonies to various parts of the earth. Some of them settled upon
  the coast of Ausonia, called in later times Italy; where they worshipped
  their great ancestor under the name of San-Chus. Silius Italicus speaking
  of the march of some Sabine troops, says,</p>

  <p>Another common name for the Deity was Dis, Dus, and the like;

  people in the east. Probably the Deity Bendis, whose rites were so
  celebrated in Phrygia and Thrace, was a compound of Ben-Dis, the
  offspring of God. The natives of this country represented Bendis as a
  female; and supposed her to be the same as <a name="footnotetag152"
  href="#footnote152"><sup>[152]</sup></a>Selene, or the moon. The same
  Deity was often masculine and feminine: what was Dea Luna in one country,
  was Deus Lunus in another.</p>

<h4>KUR, <span title="KYROS" class="grk">&#x39A;Y&#x3A1;&#x39F;&#x3A3;</span>, CURA.</h4>

  <p>The Sun was likewise named Kur, Cur, <span title="Kuros" class="grk"

  Curesta, Curestica regio. Many rivers in Persis, Media, Iberia, were
  denominated in the same manner. The term is sometimes expressed Corus:
  hence Corusia in Scythia. Of this term I shall say more hereafter.</p>

<h4>COHEN, or CAHEN.</h4>

  <p>Cohen, which seems, among the Egyptians and other Amonians, to have
  been pronounced Cahen, and Chan, signified a Priest; also a Lord or
  Prince. In early times the office of a Prince and of a Priest were
  comprehended under one character.</p>

  <p>This continued a great while in some parts of the <a
  name="footnotetag155" href="#footnote155"><sup>[155]</sup></a>world;
  especially in Asia Minor, where, even in the time of the Romans, the
  chief priest was the prince of the <a name="footnotetag156"
  href="#footnote156"><sup>[156]</sup></a>province. The term was sometimes
  used with a greater latitude; and denoted any thing noble and divine.
  Hence we find it prefixed to the names both of Deities and men; and of
  places denominated from them. It is often compounded with Athoth, as
  Canethoth; and we meet with Can-Osiris, Can-ophis, Can-ebron, and the
  like. It was sometimes expressed Kun, and among the Athenians was the
  title of the antient priests of Apollo; whose posterity were styled <span

  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>,

  We find from hence, that Apollo was styled <span title="Kunnios" class="grk"

  <p>We find this term oftentimes subjoined. The Chaldeans, who were
  particularly possessed of the land of Ur, and were worshippers of fire,
  had the name of Urchani. Strabo limits this title to one branch of the
  Chaldeans, who were literati, and observers of the heavens; and even of
  these to one sect only. <span title="Esti de kai tôn Chaldaiôn tôn Astronomikôn genê pleiô; kai gar" class="grk"

  But <a name="footnotetag160"
  href="#footnote160"><sup>[160]</sup></a>Ptolemy speaks of them more truly

  Tigris. <a name="footnotetag161"

  applies it to societies of his own priests and people; but it was a term
  borrowed from Chaldea.</p>

  <p>The title of Urchan among the Gentile nations was appropriated to the
  God of fire, and his <a name="footnotetag163"
  href="#footnote163"><sup>[163]</sup></a>priests; but was assumed by other
  persons. Some of the priests and princes among the Jews, after the return
  from captivity, took the name of Hyrcanus. Orchan, and Orchanes among the
  Persic and Tartar nations is very common at this <a name="footnotetag164"
  href="#footnote164"><sup>[164]</sup></a>day; among whom the word Chan is
  ever current for a prince or king. Hence we read of Mangu Chan, Cublai
  Chan, Cingis Chan. Among some of these nations it is expressed Kon, Kong,
  and King. Monsieur de Lisle, speaking of the Chinese, says, <a

<h4>PETAH.</h4>

  <p>Of this Amonian term of honour I have taken notice in a treatise

  as Petiphra, Petiphera, Petisonius, Petosiris, Petarbemis, Petubastus the
  Tanite, and Petesuccus, builder of the Labyrinth. Petes, called Peteos in
  Homer, the father of Mnestheus, the Athenian, is of the same original: <a

  charioteer to Xerxes in his expedition to Greece: but he was denominated
  from another office; for he was brother to Smerdis, and a Magus; which
  was a priest of the Sun. The term is sometimes subjoined, as in
  Atropatia, a province in <a name="footnotetag170"

  &#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;.</span> This
  etymology is founded upon a notion that the Amazons were a community of
  women, who killed every man, with whom they had any commerce, and yet
  subsisted as a people for ages. I shall hereafter speak of the nations
  under this title; for there were more than one: but all of one family;
  all colonies from Egypt. The title above was given them from their
  worship: for Oiorpata, or, as some MSS. have it, Aor-pata, is the same as
  <a name="footnotetag173" href="#footnote173"><sup>[173]</sup></a>Petah
  Or, the priest of Orus; or, in a more lax sense, the votaries of that
  God. They were <span title="Androktonoi" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BD;&#x3B4;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>;
  for they sacrificed all strangers, whom fortune brought upon their coast:
  so that the whole Euxine sea, upon which they lived, was rendered
  infamous from their cruelty: but they did not take their name from this
  circumstance.</p>

  <p>One of the Egyptian Deities was named Neith, and Neit; and analogous
  to the above her priests were styled <a name="footnotetag174"
  href="#footnote174"><sup>[174]</sup></a>Pataneit. They were also named
  Sonchin, which signifies a priest of the Sun: for Son, San, Zan, are of
  the same signification; and Son-Chin is <span title="Zanos hiereus" class="grk"
  >&#x396;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x1F31;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>. Proclus says, that it
  was the title of the priests; and particularly of him, who presided in
  the college of Neith at Saïs.</p>

<h4>BEL and BAAL.</h4>

  <p>Bel, Bal, or Baal, is a Babylonish title, appropriated to the Sun; and
  made use of by the Amonians in other countries; particularly in Syria and
  Canaan. It signified <span title="Kurios" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, or Lord, and is often
  compounded with other terms; as in Bel-Adon, Belorus, Bal-hamon,
  Belochus, Bel-on; (from which last came Bellona of the Romans) and also
  Baal-shamaim, the great Lord of the Heavens. This was a title given by
  the Syrians to the Sun: <a name="footnotetag175"
  href="#footnote175"><sup>[175]</sup></a><span title="Ton Hêlion Beelsamên kalousin, ho esti para Phoinixi Kurios Ouranou, Zeus de par' Hellêsi." class="grk"

  &#x392;&#x3B5;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3C3;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;, &#x1F41;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9; &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;
  &#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;

  &#x39F;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;,
  &#x396;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2; &#x3B4;&#x3B5; &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;'
  &#x1F19;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;.</span> We may, from hence,
  decypher the name of the Sun, as mentioned before by Damascius, who
  styles that Deity Bolathes: <a name="footnotetag176"
  href="#footnote176"><sup>[176]</sup></a><span title="Phoinikes kai Suroi ton Kronon Êl, kai Bêl, kai Bolathên eponomazousi." class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x3A3;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;
  &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD; &#x39A;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x397;&#x3BB;, &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x392;&#x3B7;&#x3BB;,
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x392;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;.</span>
  What he terms Bolathes is a compound of Bal-Ath, or Bal-Athis; the same
  as Atis, and Atish of Lydia, Persis, and other countries. Philo Biblius
  interprets it Zeus: Damascius supposed it to mean Cronus; as did likewise
  Theophilus: <a name="footnotetag177"
  href="#footnote177"><sup>[177]</sup></a><span title="Enioi men sebontai ton Kronon, kai touton auton onomazousi Bêl, kai Bal, malista hoi oikountes ta anatolika klimata." class="grk"

  &#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD; &#x39A;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;,
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;
  &#x392;&#x3B7;&#x3BB;, &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x392;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;,
  &#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B1; &#x1F41;&#x3B9;
  &#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;
  &#x3C4;&#x3B1;

  &#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;.</span> This diversity
  amounts to little: for I shall hereafter shew, that all the Grecian names
  of Deities, however appropriated, were originally titles of one God, and
  related to the Sun.</p>

<h4>KEREN.</h4>

  <p>Keren signifies, in its original sense, <i>a horn</i>: but was always
  esteemed an emblem of power; and made use of as a title of sovereignty
  and puissance. Hence, it is common with the sacred writers to say <a
  name="footnotetag178" href="#footnote178"><sup>[178]</sup></a><i>My horn
  shalt thou exalt&mdash;<a name="footnotetag179"
  href="#footnote179"><sup>[179]</sup></a>his horn shall be exalted with
  honour&mdash;<a name="footnotetag180"
  href="#footnote180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>the horn of Moab is cut off:</i>
  and the Evangelist<a name="footnotetag181"
  href="#footnote181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> speaks of Christ as <i>a horn of
  salvation</i> to the world. The Greeks often changed the nu final into
  sigma: hence, from keren they formed <span title="keras, keratos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>: and from thence
  they deduced the words <span title="kratos, krateros" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>: also
  <span title="koiranos, kreôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, and <span title="karênon" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>; all relating
  to strength and eminence. Gerenius, <span title="Gerênios" class="grk"
  >&#x393;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, applied
  to Nestor, is an Amonian term, and signifies a princely and venerable
  person. The Egyptian Crane, for its great services, was held in high
  honour, being sacred to the God of light, Abis (<span lang="he" title="AB ASH"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D1; &#x5D0;&#x5E9;</bdo></span>) or, as the
  Greeks expressed it, Ibis; from whence the name was given. It was also
  called Keren and Kerenus: by the Greeks <span title="Geranos" class="grk"
  >&#x393;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, the noble
  bird, being most honoured of any. It was a title of the Sun himself: for
  Apollo was named Craneüs, and <a name="footnotetag182"
  href="#footnote182"><sup>[182]</sup></a>Carneüs; which was no other than
  Cereneüs, the supreme Deity, the Lord of light: and his festival styled
  Carnea, <span title="Karneia" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>, was an
  abbreviation of <span title="Kereneia" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>,
  Cerenea. The priest of Cybele in Phrygia was styled Carnas; which was a
  title of the Deity, whom he served; and of the same purport as Carneus
  above.</p>

<h4>OPH.</h4>

  <p>Oph signifies a serpent, and was pronounced at times and expressed,
  Ope, <a name="footnotetag183"
  href="#footnote183"><sup>[183]</sup></a>Oupis, Opis, Ops; and, by Cicero,
  <a name="footnotetag184" href="#footnote184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>Upis. It
  was an emblem of the Sun; and also of time and eternity. It was
  worshipped as a Deity, and esteemed the same as Osiris; by others the
  same as Vulcan. Vulcanus Ægyptiis Opas dictus est, eodem Cicerone <a
  name="footnotetag185" href="#footnote185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>teste. A
  serpent was also, in the Egyptian language, styled Ob, or Aub: though it
  may possibly be only a variation of the term above. We are told by Orus
  Apollo, that the basilisk, or royal serpent, was named Oubaios: <a
  name="footnotetag186" href="#footnote186"><sup>[186]</sup></a><span
  title="Oubaios, ho estin Hellênisti Basiliskos" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C5;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;, &#x1F41;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;
  &#x1F19;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;
  &#x392;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>.
  It should have been rendered <span title="Oubos" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C5;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Oubus; for <span
  title="Oubaios" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C5;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> is a
  possessive, and not a proper name. The Deity, so denominated, was
  esteemed prophetic; and his temples were applied to as oracular. This
  idolatry is alluded to by Moses,<a name="footnotetag187"
  href="#footnote187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> who, in the name of God, forbids
  the Israelites ever to inquire of those dæmons, Ob and Ideone: which
  shews that it was of great antiquity. The symbolical worship of the
  serpent was, in the first ages, very extensive; and was introduced into
  all the mysteries, wherever celebrated: <a name="footnotetag188"
  href="#footnote188"><sup>[188]</sup></a><span title="Para panti tôn nomizomenôn par' humin Theôn OPHIS sumbolon mega kai mustêrion anagraphetai" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1; &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;
  &#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3B6;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;' &#x1F51;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;
  &#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD; &#x39F;&#x3A6;&#x399;&#x3A3;
  &#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3B1; &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3BC;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>.
  It is remarkable, that wherever the Amonians founded any places of
  worship, and introduced their rites, there was generally some story of a
  serpent. There was a legend about a serpent at Colchis, at Thebes, and at
  Delphi; likewise in other places. The Greeks called Apollo himself
  Python, which is the same as Opis, Oupis, and Oub. The woman at Endor,
  who had a familiar spirit, is called <a name="footnotetag189"
  href="#footnote189"><sup>[189]</sup></a><span lang="he" title="AWB" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5D1;</bdo></span>, Oub, or Ob; and it is
  interpreted Pythonissa. The place where she resided, seems to have been
  named from the worship there instituted: for Endor is compounded of
  En-Ador, and signifies Fons Pythonis, the fountain of light, the oracle
  of the God Ador. This oracle was, probably, founded by the Canaanites;
  and had never been totally suppressed. In antient times they had no
  images in their temples, but, in lieu of them, used conical stones or
  pillars, called <span title="Baitulia" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>; under
  which representation this Deity was often worshipped. His pillar was also
  called <a name="footnotetag190"
  href="#footnote190"><sup>[190]</sup></a>Abaddir, which should be
  expressed Abadir, being a compound of Ab, <span lang="he" title="AWB"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5D1;</bdo></span>, and Adir; and means
  the serpent Deity, Addir, the same as Adorus. It was also compounded with
  On, a title of the same Deity: and Kircher says that Obion is still,
  among the people of Egypt, the name of a serpent. <span lang="he"
  title="AWB" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5D1;</bdo></span>, Ob Mosi,
  Python, vox ab Ægyptiis sumpta; quibus Obion hodieque serpentem sonat.
  Ita <a name="footnotetag191"
  href="#footnote191"><sup>[191]</sup></a>Kircher. The same also occurs in
  the Coptic lexicon. The worship of the serpent was very antient among the
  Greeks, and is said to have been introduced by Cecrops. <a
  name="footnotetag192" href="#footnote192"><sup>[192]</sup></a>Philochorus
  Saturno, et Opi, primam in Atticâ statuisse aram Cecropem dicit. But
  though some represent Opis as a distinct Deity; yet <a
  name="footnotetag193" href="#footnote193"><sup>[193]</sup></a>others
  introduce the term rather as a title, and refer it to more Deities than
  one: Callimachus, who expresses it Oupis, confers it upon Diana, and
  plays upon the sacred term:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag194" href="#footnote194"><sup>[194]</sup></a><span title="Oupi, anass' euôpi" class="grk">&#x39F;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;, &#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3C3;' &#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C9;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;</span>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is often compounded with Chan; and expressed Canopus, Canophis,
  Canuphis, Cnuphis, Cneph: it is also otherwise combined; as in Ophon,
  Ophion, Oropus, Orobus, Inopus, Asopus, Elopus, Ophitis, Onuphis, Ophel.
  From Caneph the Grecians formed Cyniphius, which they used for an epithet
  to Ammon:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag195" href="#footnote195"><sup>[195]</sup></a>Non hic Cyniphius canetur Ammon,</p>
      <p>Mitratum caput elevans arenis.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>On the subject of serpent worship I shall speak more at large in a
  particular treatise.</p>

<h4>AIN.</h4>

  <p>Ain, An, En, for so it is at times expressed, signifies a fountain,
  and was prefixed to the names of many places which were situated near
  fountains, and were denominated from them. In Canaan, near the fords of
  Jordan, were some celebrated waters; which, from their name, appear to
  have been, of old, sacred to the Sun. The name of the place was <a
  name="footnotetag196" href="#footnote196"><sup>[196]</sup></a>Ænon, or
  the fountain of the Sun; the same to which people resorted to be baptized
  by John: not from an opinion that there was any sanctity in the waters;
  for that notion had been for ages obliterated; and the name was given by
  the Canaanite: but <a name="footnotetag197"
  href="#footnote197"><sup>[197]</sup></a><i>John baptized in Ænon, near to
  Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were
  baptized</i>. Many places were styled An-ait, An-abor, Anabouria,
  Anathon, Anopus, Anorus. Some of these were so called from their
  situation; others from the worship there established. The Egyptians had
  many subordinate Deities, which they esteemed so many emanations, <span
  title="aporrhoiai" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x1FE4;&#x1FE5;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>
  from their chief God; as we learn from Iamblichus, Psellus, and Porphyry.
  These derivatives they called <a name="footnotetag198"
  href="#footnote198"><sup>[198]</sup></a>fountains, and supposed them to
  be derived from the Sun; whom they looked upon as the source of all
  things. Hence they formed Ath-El and Ath-Ain, the <a
  name="footnotetag199" href="#footnote199"><sup>[199]</sup></a>Athela and
  Athena of the Greeks. These were two titles appropriated to the same
  personage, Divine Wisdom; who was supposed to spring from the head of her
  father. Wherever the Amonian religion was propagated, names of this sort
  will occur; being originally given from the mode of worship established<a
  name="footnotetag200" href="#footnote200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>. Hence so
  many places styled Anthedon, Anthemus, Ain-shemesh, and the like. The
  nymph &#338;none was, in reality, a fountain, Ain-On, in Phrygia; and
  sacred to the same Deity: and, agreeably to this, she is said to have
  been the daughter of the river <a name="footnotetag201"
  href="#footnote201"><sup>[201]</sup></a>Cebrenus. The island Ægina was
  named <a name="footnotetag202"
  href="#footnote202"><sup>[202]</sup></a>&#338;none, and &#338;nopia,
  probably from its worship. As Divine Wisdom was sometimes expressed
  Ath-Ain, or <span title="Athêna" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B8;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>; so, at other times, the
  terms were reversed, and a Deity constituted called An-Ait. Temples to
  this goddess occur at Ecbatana in Media: also in Mesopotamia, Persis,
  Armenia, and Cappadocia; where the rites of fire were particularly
  observed. She was not unknown among the antient Canaanites; for a temple
  called Beth-Anath is mentioned in the book of <a name="footnotetag203"
  href="#footnote203"><sup>[203]</sup></a>Joshua. Of these temples, and the
  Puratheia there established, accounts may be seen in many parts of
  Strabo.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned, that all springs and baths were sacred to the Sun:
  on which account they were called Bal-ain; the fountains of the great
  Lord of Heaven; from whence the Greeks formed <span title="Balaneia" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>: and the
  Romans Balnea. The southern seas abounded formerly with large whales: and
  it is well known, that they have apertures near their nostrils, through
  which they spout water in a large stream, and to a great height. Hence
  they too had the name of Bal-Ain, or Balænæ. For every thing uncommon was
  by the Amonians consecrated to the Deity, and denominated from his
  titles. This is very apparent in all the animals of Egypt.</p>

  <p>The term <span title="Ouranos" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Ouranus,
  related properly to the orb of the Sun; but was in aftertimes made to
  comprehend the whole expanse of the heavens. It is compounded of Ourain,
  the fountain of Orus; and shews to what it alludes, by its etymology.
  Many places were named Ees-ain, the reverse of Ain-ees, or Hanes: and
  others farther compounded Am-ees-ain, and Cam-ees-ain, rendered Amisene,
  and Camisene: the natural histories of which places will generally
  authenticate the etymology. The Amonians settled upon the Tiber: and the
  antient town Janiculum was originally named <a name="footnotetag204"
  href="#footnote204"><sup>[204]</sup></a>Camese; and the region about it
  Camesene: undoubtedly from the fountain Camesene, called afterward Anna
  Perenna, whose waters ran into the sacred pool <a name="footnotetag205"
  href="#footnote205"><sup>[205]</sup></a>Numicius: and whose priests were
  the Cam&#339;næ.</p>

  <p>I am sensible, that some very learned men do not quite approve of
  terms being thus reversed, as I have exhibited them in Ath-ain, Bal-ain,
  Our-ain, Cam-ain, and in other examples: and it is esteemed a deviation
  from the common usage in the Hebrew language; where the governing word,
  as it is termed, always comes first. Of this there are many instances;
  such as Ain-Shemesh, Ain-Gaddi, Ain-Mishpat, Ain-Rogel, &amp;c. also
  Beth-El, Beth-Dagon, Beth-Aven, Beth-Oron. But, with submission, this
  does not affect the etymologies, which I have laid before the reader: for
  I do not deduce them from the Hebrew. And though there may have been of
  old a great similitude between that language, and those of Egypt, Cutha,
  and Canaan: yet they were all different tongues. There was once but one
  language among the sons of men<a name="footnotetag206"
  href="#footnote206"><sup>[206]</sup></a>. Upon the dispersion of mankind,
  this was branched out into dialects; and those again were subdivided: all
  which varied every age, not only in respect to one another; but each
  language differed from itself more and more continually. It is therefore
  impossible to reduce the whole of these to the mode, and standard of any
  one. Besides, the terms, of which I suppose these names to be formed, are
  not properly in regimine; but are used adjectively, as is common almost
  in every language. We meet in the Grecian writings with <a

  &#x3A3;&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3B8;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>. Why may we not suppose, that
  the same usage prevailed in Cutha, and in Egypt? And this practice was
  not entirely foreign to the Hebrews. We read indeed of Beer-sheba,
  Beer-lahoiroi, &amp;c. but we also read of <a name="footnotetag208"
  href="#footnote208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> Baalath-Beer, exactly similar to
  the instances which I have produced. We meet in the sacred writings with
  Beth-El, and Beth-Dagon: but we sometimes find the governing word
  postponed, as in Elizabeth, or temple of Eliza. It was a Canaanitish<a
  name="footnotetag209" href="#footnote209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> name, the
  same as Elisa, Eleusa, Elasa of Greece and other countries. It was a
  compound of El-Ees, and related to the God of light, as I have before
  shewn. It was made a feminine in aftertimes: and was a name assumed by
  women of the country styled Phenicia, as well as by those of Carthage.
  Hence Dido has this as a secondary appellation; and mention is made by
  the Poet of Dii morientis <a name="footnotetag210"
  href="#footnote210"><sup>[210]</sup></a>Elizæ, though it was properly the
  name of a Deity. It may be said, that these names are foreign to the
  Hebrews, though sometimes adopted by them: and I readily grant it; for it
  is the whole, that I contend for. All, that I want to have allowed, is,
  that different nations in their several tongues had different modes of
  collocation and expression: because I think it as unreasonable to
  determine the usage of the Egyptians and antient Chaldeans by the method
  of the Hebrews, as it would be to reduce the Hebrew to the mode and
  standard of Egypt. What in Joshua, c. 19. v. 8. is Baaleth, is, 1 Kings,
  c. 16. v. 31. Eth-baal: so that even in the sacred writings we find terms
  of this sort transposed. But in respect to foreign names, especially of
  places, there are numberless instances similar to those, which I have
  produced. They occur in all histories of countries both antient and
  modern. We read of Pharbeth, and Phainobeth in Egypt: of Themiskir, and
  <a name="footnotetag211"
  href="#footnote211"><sup>[211]</sup></a>Tigranocerta, which signifies
  Tigranes' city, in Cappadocia, and Armenia. Among the eastern nations at
  this day the names of the principal places are of this manner of
  construction; such as Pharsabad, Jehenabad, Amenabad: such also Indostan,
  Pharsistan, Mogulistan, with many others. Hence I hope, if I meet with a
  temple or city, called Hanes, or Urania, I may venture to derive it from
  An-Eees, or Ur-Ain, however the terms may be disposed. And I may proceed
  farther to suppose that it was denominated the fountain of light; as I am
  able to support my etymology by the history of the place. Or if I should
  meet with a country called Azania, I may in like manner derive it from
  Az-An, a fountain sacred to the Sun; from whence the country was named.
  And I may suppose this fountain to have been sacred to the God of light,
  on account of some real, or imputed, quality in its waters: especially if
  I have any history to support my etymology. As there was a region named
  Azania in Arcadia, the reader may judge of my interpretation by the
  account given of the excellence of its waters. <a name="footnotetag212"

  Hanes in <a name="footnotetag213"
  href="#footnote213"><sup>[213]</sup></a>Egypt was the reverse of Azan;
  formed however of the same terms, and of the same purport precisely.</p>

  <p>In respect to this city it may be objected, that if it had signified,
  what I suppose, we should have found it in the sacred text, instead of
  <span lang="he" title="CHNS" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D7;&#x5E0;&#x5E1;</bdo></span>, expressed <span lang="he"
  title="`YN ASH" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E2;&#x5D9;&#x5DF;
  &#x5D0;&#x5E9;</bdo></span>. If this were true, we must be obliged to
  suppose, whenever the sacred writers found a foreign name, composed of
  terms not unlike some in their own language, that they formed them
  according to their own mode of expression, and reduced them to the Hebrew
  orthography. In short, if the etymology of an Egyptian or Syriac name
  could be possibly obtained in their own language, that they had always an
  eye to such etymology; and rendered the word precisely according to the
  Hebrew manner of writing and pronunciation. But this cannot be allowed.
  We cannot suppose the sacred writers to have been so unnecessarily
  scrupulous. As far as I can judge, they appear to have acted in a manner
  quite the reverse. They seem to have laid down an excellent rule, which
  would have been attended with great utility, had it been universally
  followed: this was, of exhibiting every name, as it was expressed at the
  time when they wrote, and by the people, to whom they addressed
  themselves. If this people, through length of time, did not keep up to
  the original etymology in their pronunciation, it was unnecessary for the
  sacred Penmen to maintain it in their writings. They wrote to be
  understood: but would have defeated their own purpose, if they had called
  things by names, which no longer existed. If length of time had
  introduced any variations, those changes were attended to: what was
  called Shechem by Moses, is termed <a name="footnotetag214"

  Aphytis, is a city hard by Pallene, in Thrace; so called from one Aphys,
  a native of those parts. This city had once an oracular temple of
  Ammon</i>.</p>

  <p>It stood in the very country called Phlegra, where the worship of fire
  once particularly prevailed. There was a city Aphace; also a temple of
  that name in Mount Libanus, sacred to Venus Aphacitis, and denominated
  from fire. Here, too, was an oracle: for most temples of old were
  supposed to be oracular. It is described by Zosimus, who says, <a
  name="footnotetag223" href="#footnote223"><sup>[223]</sup></a>that near
  the temple was a large lake, made by art, in shape like a star. About the
  building, and in the neighbouring ground, there at times appeared a fire
  of a globular figure, which burned like a lamp. It generally shewed
  itself at times when a celebrity was held: and, he adds, that even in his
  time it was frequently seen.</p>

  <p>All the Deities of Greece were <span title="apospasmata" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>,
  or derivatives, formed from the titles of Amon, and Orus, the Sun. Many
  of them betray this in their secondary appellations: for, we read not
  only of Vulcan, but of Diana being called <a name="footnotetag224"
  href="#footnote224"><sup>[224]</sup></a>Apha, and Aphæa; and in Crete
  Dictynna had the same name: Hesychius observes, <span title="Aphaia, hê Diktunna" class="grk"

  &#x394;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>. Castor

  >&#x391;&#x3C6;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>:
  and Mars <a name="footnotetag226"
  href="#footnote226"><sup>[226]</sup></a>Aphæus was worshipped in Arcadia.
  Apollo was likewise called <a name="footnotetag227"
  href="#footnote227"><sup>[227]</sup></a><span title="Aphêtôr" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C6;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;</span>: but it was properly
  the place of worship; though Hesychius otherwise explains it. Aphetor was
  what the antient Dorians expressed Apha-Tor, a <a name="footnotetag228"
  href="#footnote228"><sup>[228]</sup></a>fire tower, or Prutaneum; the
  same which the Latines called of old Pur-tor, of the like signification.
  This, in aftertimes, was rendered Prætorium: and the chief persons, who
  officiated, Prætores. They were originally priests of fire; and, for that
  reason, were called <a name="footnotetag229"
  href="#footnote229"><sup>[229]</sup></a>Aphetæ: and every Prætor had a
  brazier of live coals carried before him, as a badge of his office.</p>

<h4>AST, ASTA, ESTA, HESTIA.</h4>

  <p>Ast, Asta, Esta, signified fire; and also the Deity of that element.
  The Greeks expressed it <span title="Hestia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F19;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>, and the Romans, Vesta.
  Plutarch, speaking of the sacred water of Numicius being discovered by
  the priestesses of this Deity, calls them the virgins of <a
  name="footnotetag230" href="#footnote230"><sup>[230]</sup></a>Hestia.
  Esta and Asta signified also a sacred hearth. In early times every
  district was divided according to the number of the sacred hearths; each
  of which constituted a community, or parish. They were, in different
  parts, styled Puratheia, Empureia, Prutaneia, and Prætoria: also <a
  name="footnotetag231" href="#footnote231"><sup>[231]</sup></a>Phratriai,
  and Apaturia: but the most common name was Asta.</p>

  <p>These were all places of general rendezvous for people of the same
  community. Here were kept up perpetual fires: and places of this sort
  were made use of for courts of judicature, where the laws of the country,
  <span title="themistai" class="grk"
  >&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>, were
  explained, and enforced. Hence Homer speaking of a person not worthy of
  the rights of society, calls him <a name="footnotetag232"
  href="#footnote232"><sup>[232]</sup></a><span title="Aphrêtôr, athemistos, anestios" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C6;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;,
  &#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>.</p>

  <p>The names of these buildings were given to them from the rites there
  practised; all which related to fire. The term Asta was in aftertimes by
  the Greeks expressed, <span title="Astu" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;</span>, Astu; and appropriated to a city.
  The name of Athens was at first <a name="footnotetag233"
  href="#footnote233"><sup>[233]</sup></a>Astu; and then Athenæ of the same
  purport: for Athenæ is a compound of Ath-En, Ignis fons; in which name
  there is a reference both to the guardian Goddess of the city; and also
  to the perpetual fire preserved within its precincts. The God of fire,
  Hephaistus, was an Egyptian compound of Apha-Astus, rendered by the
  Ionian Greeks Hephæstus.</p>

  <p>The <a name="footnotetag234"
  href="#footnote234"><sup>[234]</sup></a>Cam&#339;næ of Latium, who were
  supposed to have shewn the sacred fountain to the Vestals, were probably
  the original priestesses, whose business it was to fetch water for
  lustrations from that stream. For Cam-Ain is the fountain of the Sun: and
  the Cam&#339;næ were named from their attendance upon that Deity. The
  Hymns in the temples of this God were sung by these women: hence the
  Cam&#339;næ were made presidents of music.</p>

  <p>Many regions, where the rites of fire were kept up, will be found to
  have been named Asta, Hestia, Hestiæa, Hephæstia; or to have had cities
  so <a name="footnotetag235"
  href="#footnote235"><sup>[235]</sup></a>called. This will appear from the
  histories of Thessaly, Lycia, Egypt, Lemnos; as well as from other
  countries.</p>

  <p>From Asta and Esta come the terms Æstas, Æstus, Æstuo, <span
  title="Astu, Hestia, Hestiazein." class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;, &#x1F19;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;,
  &#x1F19;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;.</span></p>

<h4>SHEM, SHAMEN, SHEMESH.</h4>

  <p>Shem, and Shamesh, are terms, which relate to the heavens, and to the
  Sun, similar to <span lang="he" title="SHMSH SHMYS SHWM" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5DE;&#x5E9; &#x5E9;&#x5DE;&#x5D9;&#x5E1;

  reputed sanctity, such as Same, Samos, Samothrace, Samorna, were
  denominated from it. Philo Biblius informs us, that the Syrians, and
  Canaanites, lifted up their hands to Baal-Samen, the Lord of Heaven;
  under which title they honoured the Sun: <a name="footnotetag236"

  Ephesus was a place of great sanctity: and its original name was <a
  name="footnotetag237" href="#footnote237"><sup>[237]</sup></a>Samorna;
  which seems to be a compound of Sam-Oran, C&#339;lestis Sol, fons Lucis.
  We read of Samicon in Elis, <a name="footnotetag238"
  href="#footnote238"><sup>[238]</sup></a><span title="chôrion Samikon" class="grk"

  href="#footnote239"><sup>[239]</sup></a>Samia, which lay above it. The
  word <span title="Semnos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A3;&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> was a contraction of
  Semanos, from Sema-on; and properly signified divine and celestial. Hence
  <span title="semnai theai, semnê kora" class="grk"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;,

  Antient Syria was particularly devoted to the worship of the Sun, and of
  the Heavens; and it was by the natives called Shems and Shams: which
  undoubtedly means the land of Shemesh, from the worship there followed.
  It retains the name at this <a name="footnotetag240"
  href="#footnote240"><sup>[240]</sup></a>day. In Canaan was a town and
  temple, called Beth-Shemesh. What some expressed Shem and Sham, the Lubim
  seem to have pronounced Zam: hence the capital of Numidia was named Zama,
  and Zamana, from Shamen, C&#339;lestis. This we may learn from an
  inscription in <a name="footnotetag241"

  <p>Ham being the Apollo of the east, was worshipped as the Sun; and was
  also called Sham and Shem. This has been the cause of much perplexity,
  and mistake: for by these means many of his posterity have been referred
  to a wrong line, and reputed the sons of Shem; the title of one brother
  not being distinguished from the real name of the other. Hence the
  Chaldeans have by some been adjudged to the line of <a
  name="footnotetag243" href="#footnote243"><sup>[243]</sup></a>Shem: and
  Amalek, together with the people of that name, have been placed to the
  same account. His genealogy is accordingly represented by Ebn Patric. He
  makes him the son of Aad, and great grandson of Shem. <a
  name="footnotetag244" href="#footnote244"><sup>[244]</sup></a>Fuitque Aad
  filius Arami, filius Shemi, filius Noæ. The author of the Chronicon
  Paschale speaks of <a name="footnotetag245"
  href="#footnote245"><sup>[245]</sup></a>Chus, as of the line of Shem: and
  Theophilus in his treatise to Autolycus does the same by <a
  name="footnotetag246" href="#footnote246"><sup>[246]</sup></a>Mizraïm.
  Others go farther, and add Canaan to the <a name="footnotetag247"
  href="#footnote247"><sup>[247]</sup></a>number. Now these are confessedly
  the immediate sons of <a name="footnotetag248"
  href="#footnote248"><sup>[248]</sup></a>Ham: so that we may understand,
  who was properly alluded to in these passages under the name of Shem.</p>

<h4>MACAR.</h4>

  <p>This was a sacred title given by the Amonians to their Gods; which
  often occurs in the Orphic hymns, when any Deity is invoked.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Many people assumed to themselves this title; and were styled <a
  name="footnotetag251" href="#footnote251"><sup>[251]</sup></a><span
  title="Makares" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>, or Macarians:
  and various colonies were supposed to have been led by an imaginary
  personage, Macar, or <a name="footnotetag252"
  href="#footnote252"><sup>[252]</sup></a>Macareus. In consequence of this,
  we find that the most antient name of many cities and islands was Macra,
  Macris, and <a name="footnotetag253"
  href="#footnote253"><sup>[253]</sup></a>Macaria. The Grecians supposed
  the term Macar to signify happy; whence <span title="Makares theoi" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;
  &#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span> was interpreted <span
  title="eudaimones" class="grk"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>:
  but whether this was the original purport of the word may be difficult to
  determine. It is certain that it was a favourite term; and many places of
  sanctity were denominated from it. Macar, as a person, was by some
  esteemed the offspring of <a name="footnotetag254"
  href="#footnote254"><sup>[254]</sup></a>Lycaon; by others, the son of <a
  name="footnotetag255" href="#footnote255"><sup>[255]</sup></a>Æolus.
  Diodorus Siculus calls him <a name="footnotetag256"
  href="#footnote256"><sup>[256]</sup></a>Macareus, and speaks of him as
  the son of Jupiter. This term is often found compounded Macar-On: from
  whence people were denominated <span title="Makarônes" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>,
  and <a name="footnotetag257"
  href="#footnote257"><sup>[257]</sup></a><span title="Makrônes" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>; and
  places were called <span title="Makrôn" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>. This, probably, was
  the original of the name given to islands which were styled <span
  title="Makarôn nêsoi" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>. They were to be found in the
  Pontus Euxinus, as well as in the Atlantic. The Acropolis of Thebes in
  B&#339;otia was, in like manner, called <a name="footnotetag258"
  href="#footnote258"><sup>[258]</sup></a><span title="Makarôn nêsos" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. It was certainly an Amonian
  sacred term. The inland city, Oäsis, stood in an Egyptian province, which
  had the <a name="footnotetag259"
  href="#footnote259"><sup>[259]</sup></a>same name: so that the meaning
  must not be sought for in Greece. This term was sometimes expressed as a
  feminine, Macris, and Macra: and by the Grecians was interpreted
  <i>longa</i>; as if it related to extent. It was certainly an antient
  word, and related to their theology; but was grown so obsolete that the
  original purport could not be retrieved. I think we may be assured that
  it had no relation to length. Eub&#339;a was, of old, called Macris; and
  may be looked upon as comparatively long: but Icarus, Rhodes, and Chios,
  were likewise called so; and they did not project in length more than the
  islands in their <a name="footnotetag260"
  href="#footnote260"><sup>[260]</sup></a>neighbourhood. They were,
  therefore, not denominated from their figure. There was a cavern in the
  Acropolis of Athens, which was called Macrai, according to Euripides.</p>

    </div>

  <p>The same author shews, manifestly, that it was a proper name; and that
  the place itself was styled Macrai. This was a contraction for Macar-Ai,
  or the place of Macar:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>All these places were, for a religious reason, so denominated from
  Macar, a title of the Deity.</p>

<h4>MELECH.</h4>

  <p>Melech, or, as it is sometimes expressed, Malech, and Moloch, betokens
  a king; as does Malecha a queen. It was a title, of old, given to many
  Deities in Greece; but, in after times, grew obsolete and misunderstood:
  whence it was often changed to <span title="meilichos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, and
  <span title="meilichios" class="grk"
  >&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  which signified the gentle, sweet, and benign Deity. Pausanias tells us
  that Jupiter was styled <span title="Meilichios" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  both in <a name="footnotetag263"
  href="#footnote263"><sup>[263]</sup></a>Attica and at <a
  name="footnotetag264" href="#footnote264"><sup>[264]</sup></a>Argos: and,
  in another part of his work, he speaks of this Deity under the same
  title, in company with Artemis at Sicyon. <a name="footnotetag265"
  href="#footnote265"><sup>[265]</sup></a><span title="Esti de Zeus Meilichios, kai Artemis onomazomenê Patrôia" class="grk"
  >&#x395;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9; &#x3B4;&#x3B5; &#x396;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;
  &#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x391;&#x3C1;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;
  &#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;
  &#x3A0;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x1FF3;&#x3B1;</span>. He mentions that they
  were both of great antiquity, placed in the temple before the
  introduction of images: for, the one was represented by a pyramid, and
  the other by a bare pillar: <span title="Puramidi de ho Meilichios, hêde kioni estin eikasmenê" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B9; &#x3B4;&#x3B5;
  &#x1F41; &#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;,
  &#x1F21;&#x3B4;&#x3B5; &#x3BA;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>.
  He also speaks of some unknown Gods at Myonia in Locris, called <span
  title="Theoi Meilichioi" class="grk">&#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;
  &#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>;
  and of an altar, with an inscription of the same purport, <a
  name="footnotetag266" href="#footnote266"><sup>[266]</sup></a><span
  title="bômos Theôn Meilichiôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3B2;&#x3C9;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>.</p>

  <p>Rivers often had the name of Melech. There was one in Babylonia,
  generally expressed Nahar Malcha, or the royal stream: these too were
  often by the Grecians changed to <span title="Meilichoi" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>. The
  foregoing writer gives an instance in a <a name="footnotetag267"
  href="#footnote267"><sup>[267]</sup></a>river of Achaia. Malaga in Spain
  was properly Malacha, the royal city. I take the name of Amalek to have
  been Ham <a name="footnotetag268"
  href="#footnote268"><sup>[268]</sup></a>Melech abbreviated: a title taken
  by the Amalekites from the head of their family. In like manner I imagine
  <a name="footnotetag269" href="#footnote269"><sup>[269]</sup></a>Malchom,
  the God of the Sidonians, to have been a contraction of Malech-Chom,
  <span title="basileus Hêlios" class="grk"
  >&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;
  &#x1F29;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>: a title given to the Sun;
  but conferred also upon the chief of the Amonian <a name="footnotetag270"
  href="#footnote270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>family.</p>

<h4>ANAC.</h4>

  <p>Anac was a title of high antiquity, and seems to have been originally
  appropriated to persons of great strength, and stature. Such people in
  the plural were styled Anakim; and one family of them were to be found at
  <a name="footnotetag271"
  href="#footnote271"><sup>[271]</sup></a>Kirjath-Arba. Some of them were
  likewise among the Caphtorim, who settled in Palestina. Pausanias
  represents Asterion, whose tomb is said to have been discovered in Lydia,
  as a son of Anac, and of an enormous size. <a name="footnotetag272"

  &#x3B5;&#x3C2; &#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;,
  &#x1F61;&#x3C2; &#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B8;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x387;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3B9; &#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;

  &#x3B1;&#x3BD; &#x3B5;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3BE;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;</span>. We may
  from hence perceive that the history of the Anakim was not totally
  obliterated among the Grecians. Some of their Deities were styled <span
  title="anakte" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;</span>, others <span
  title="anaktores" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>,

  >&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>.
  Michael Psellus speaking of heresies, mentions, that some people were so
  debased, as to worship Satanaki: <a name="footnotetag273"
  href="#footnote273"><sup>[273]</sup></a><span title="Auton" class="grk"

  Satanaki seems to be Satan Anac, <span title="diabolos basileus" class="grk"

  &#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>.</p>

  <p>Necho, Nacho, Necus, Negus, which in the Egyptian and Ethiopic
  languages signified a king, probably was an abbreviation of Anaco, and
  Anachus. It was sometimes expressed Nachi, and Nacchi. The buildings
  represented at Persepolis are said to be the work of Nacki Rustan; which
  signifies the lord, or prince Rustan.</p>

<h4>ZAR, and SAR.</h4>

  <p>Sar is a rock, and made use of to signify a promontory. As temples
  were particularly erected upon such places, these eminences were often
  denominated Sar-On, from the Deity, to whom the temples were sacred. The
  term Sar was oftentimes used as a mark of high honour. The Psalmist
  repeatedly addresses God as his Rock, <a name="footnotetag274"
  href="#footnote274"><sup>[274]</sup></a>the Rock of his refuge; the Rock
  of his salvation. It is also used without a metaphor, for a title of
  respect: but it seems then to have been differently expressed. The sacred
  writers call that lordly people the Sidonians, as well as those of Tyre,
  <a name="footnotetag275" href="#footnote275"><sup>[275]</sup></a>Sarim.
  The name of Sarah was given to the wife of Abraham by way of eminence;
  and signifies a <a name="footnotetag276"
  href="#footnote276"><sup>[276]</sup></a>lady, or princess. It is
  continually to be found in the composition of names, which relate to
  places, or persons, esteemed sacred by the Amonians. We read of Serapis,
  Serapion, Serapammon: also of Sarchon, and Sardon; which is a contraction
  for Sar-Adon. In Tobit mention is made of <a name="footnotetag277"
  href="#footnote277"><sup>[277]</sup></a>Sarchedonus; the same name as the
  former, but with the eastern aspirate. The Sarim in Esther are taken
  notice of as persons of high <a name="footnotetag278"
  href="#footnote278"><sup>[278]</sup></a>honour: the same dignity seems to
  have been known among the Philistim, by whom it was rendered <a
  name="footnotetag279" href="#footnote279"><sup>[279]</sup></a>Sarna, or
  Sarana: hence came the <a name="footnotetag280"
  href="#footnote280"><sup>[280]</sup></a>Tyrian word Sarranus for any
  thing noble and splendid. In the prophet Jeremiah are enumerated the
  titles of the chief princes, who attended Nebuchadnezzar in his
  expedition against Judea. Among others he mentions the <a
  name="footnotetag281" href="#footnote281"><sup>[281]</sup></a>Sarsechim.
  This is a plural, compounded of Sar, and Sech, rendered also Shec, a
  prince or governor. Sar-Sechim signifies the chief of the princes and
  rulers. Rabshekah is nearly of the same purport: it signifies the great
  prince; as by Rabsares is meant the chief <a name="footnotetag282"
  href="#footnote282"><sup>[282]</sup></a>Eunuch; by Rabmag, the chief of
  the Magi. Many places in Syria and Canaan have the term Sar in
  composition; such as Sarabetha, Sariphæa, Sareptha. Sardis, the capital
  of Cr&#339;sus, was the city of Sar-Ades, the same as Atis, the Deity of
  the country.</p>

  <p>High <a name="footnotetag283"
  href="#footnote283"><sup>[283]</sup></a>groves, or rather hills with
  woods of antient oaks, were named Saron; because they were sacred to the
  Deity so called. Pliny takes notice of the Saronian bay near Corinth, and
  of the oaks which grew near it. <a name="footnotetag284"
  href="#footnote284"><sup>[284]</sup></a>Portus C&#339;nitis, Sinus
  Saronicus olim querno nemore redimitus; unde nomen. Both the oaks and the

  >&#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>,

  Sar-On, the Lord of light. <a name="footnotetag289"
  href="#footnote289"><sup>[289]</sup></a>Rocks were called Saronides, from
  having temples and towers sacred to this Deity: just as groves of oaks
  were, of which I took notice above. This interpretation is given by <a

<h4>UCH.</h4>

  <p>Uch, <span title="Uk" class="grk">&#x3A5;&#x3BA;</span>, expressed
  also Ach, Och, <span title="Ocha" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C7;&#x3B1;</span>, was a term of honour among the
  Babylonians, and the rest of the progeny of Chus; and occurs continually
  in the names of men and places which have any connection with their
  history. I have shewn, in a former <a name="footnotetag293"
  href="#footnote293"><sup>[293]</sup></a>treatise, that the shepherds who
  ruled in Egypt were of that race, and that they came from Babylonia and
  Chaldea. Eusebius informs us, that their national title was <a
  name="footnotetag294" href="#footnote294"><sup>[294]</sup></a><span
  title="Ukousos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; or, as it was
  undoubtedly expressed by the people themselves, <span title="Ukkousos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A5;&#x3BA;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  Uc-Cusus. It is a term taken notice of by Apion and Manethon, and they
  speak of it as a word in the sacred language of the country, which
  signified a king: <a name="footnotetag295"
  href="#footnote295"><sup>[295]</sup></a><span title="Uk kath' hieran glôssan basilea sêmainei" class="grk"
  >&#x3A5;&#x3BA; &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;'

  &#x3C3;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;</span>. I wonder
  that this word has been passed over with so little notice; as it is of
  great antiquity; and, at the same time, of much importance in respect to
  etymology. Uc-Cusus signified the royal, or noble, Cusean: and, as it was
  a word in the sacred language of Egypt, we may from hence learn what that
  language was; and be assured that it was the primitive language of Chus,
  the same as the antient Chaldaïc. It was introduced among the Mizraïm by
  the Auritæ, or Cuthites, together with their rites and religion: hence it
  obtained the name of the sacred language. Diodorus Siculus affords <a
  name="footnotetag296" href="#footnote296"><sup>[296]</sup></a>evidence to
  the same purpose: and it is farther proved by Heliodorus; who says that
  the sacred characters of Egypt and those of the Cuthites in Ethiopia were
  the <a name="footnotetag297"
  href="#footnote297"><sup>[297]</sup></a>same. This term occurs very often
  among the titles of which the Babylonish names arc composed; such as
  Ochus and Belochus. Among the Egyptians it is to be found in Acherez and
  Achencherez; which are the names of two very antient princes. Acherez is
  a compound of Ach-Ares, Magnus Sol; equivalent to Achorus, another name
  of the same Deity, assumed in like manner by their kings. The latter was
  sometimes expressed <a name="footnotetag298"
  href="#footnote298"><sup>[298]</sup></a>Achor, Achoris. Ochuras,
  Uchoreus; which are all the same name, diversified in different ages and
  by different writers. As priests took the titles of the Deities whom they
  served, Lucan has, very properly, introduced a priest of Egypt under the
  name of Achoreus:</p>

  <p>The name of Osiris seems to have been Uc-Sehor, and Uc-Sehoris.
  According to Hellanicus, if a person had in Egypt made inquiry about the
  term Osiris, he would not have been understood: for the true name was <a
  name="footnotetag300" href="#footnote300"><sup>[300]</sup></a>Usiris.
  Philo Biblius, from Sanchoniathon, calls the same Deity <a
  name="footnotetag301" href="#footnote301"><sup>[301]</sup></a>Isiris; and
  adds, that he was the brother of Cna, or Canaan; and the inventor of
  three letters. <span title="Isiris, tôn triôn grammatôn heuretês, adelphos Chna tou Phoinikos" class="grk"

  &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;
  &#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. I take
  Isiris and Usiris, as well as Osiris, to be all Uc-Sehoris softened, and
  accommodated to the ears of Greece.</p>

  <p>The Sun was styled El-Uc, which the Grecians changed to <span
  title="Lukos" class="grk">&#x39B;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  Lucos; as we learn from <a name="footnotetag302"
  href="#footnote302"><sup>[302]</sup></a>Macrobius. He was also styled
  El-Uc-Or, which was changed to <span title="Lukôreus" class="grk"
  >&#x39B;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>; and
  El-Uc-Aon, rendered Lycaon<a name="footnotetag303"

  >&#x39B;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>. As this personage was
  the same as El-Uc, <span title="Lukos" class="grk"
  >&#x39B;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, it was fabled of him that he
  was turned into a wolf. The cause of this absurd notion arose from hence:
  every sacred animal in Egypt was distinguished by some title of the
  Deity. But the Greeks never considered whether the term was to be taken
  in its primary, or in its secondary acceptation; whence they referred the
  history to an animal, when it related to the God from whom the animal was
  denominated. <span title="Lukos" class="grk"
  >&#x39B;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Lucos, was, as I have shewn,
  the name of the Sun: hence, wherever this term occurs in composition,
  there will be commonly found some reference to that Deity, or to his
  substitute Apollo. We read of <a name="footnotetag304"

  href="#footnote305"><sup>[305]</sup></a>Lycorus, a supposed son of
  Apollo: of <a name="footnotetag306"
  href="#footnote306"><sup>[306]</sup></a>Lycomedes, another son: of <a
  name="footnotetag307" href="#footnote307"><sup>[307]</sup></a>Lycosura,
  the first city which the Sun beheld. The people of Delphi were, of old,
  called <a name="footnotetag308"
  href="#footnote308"><sup>[308]</sup></a>Lycorians: and the summit of
  Parnassus, <a name="footnotetag309"
  href="#footnote309"><sup>[309]</sup></a>Lycorea. Near it was a <a
  name="footnotetag310" href="#footnote310"><sup>[310]</sup></a>town of the
  same name; and both were sacred to the God of light. From Lucos, in this
  sense, came lux, luceo, lucidus, and Jupiter Lucetius, of the Latines;
  and <span title="luchnos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3C7;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, <span title="luchnia" class="grk"

  >&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  though differently expressed. Hence it was that so many places sacred to
  Apollo were styled Leuce, Leuca, <span title="Lukia" class="grk"

  there worshipped: as was <span title="Haimos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F09;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, a word of the same purport
  among the Greeks.</p>

  <p>This people, who received their theology from Egypt and Syria, often
  suppressed the leading vowel; and thought to atone for it by giving a new
  termination: though to say the truth, this mode of abbreviation is often
  to be observed in the original language, from whence these terms are
  derived. <span title="Kuros" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, the name of Cyrus, seems to
  have suffered an abridgment of this nature. It was probably a compound of
  Uch-Ur, the same as Achor, and Achorus of Egypt, the great luminary, the
  Sun. In antient times all kings, priests, and people of consequence took
  to themselves some sacred title. But as Aneith was abbreviated to Neith,
  Acherez to Cherez; so Achorus was rendered Chorus, Curus. Thus far is
  manifest, that Curus signified the Sun. <a name="footnotetag313"

  a fountain here of great sanctity, which was in like manner denominated
  from the Sun. It was called <a name="footnotetag319"
  href="#footnote319"><sup>[319]</sup></a><span title="Kurê pêgê," class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B7; &#x3C0;&#x3B7;&#x3B3;&#x3B7;,</span> which
  terms are equivalent to Kur-Ain, and Achurain of the Amonians, and
  signify the fountain of the Sun. Pliny proves, that this was the purport
  of the terms, when he describes this part of the world. <a
  name="footnotetag320" href="#footnote320"><sup>[320]</sup></a>Cyrenaïca,

  which related to the Sun; we find it often compounded with <span
  title="Ôn" class="grk">&#x3A9;&#x3BD;</span>, On, another name of that
  Deity; from whence was formed Acharon. This was the true name of the city
  in Palestine, called in Scripture, according to our version, <a
  name="footnotetag323" href="#footnote323"><sup>[323]</sup></a>Ekron. It
  was denominated from Achor, the God of flies, worshipped also under the
  name of Baal-zebub with the same attribute. The Caphtorim brought the
  worship of this God from Egypt; where was a river called Acharon; so
  denominated from the Deity of the country. This river, and the rites
  practised in its vicinity, are mentioned in a beautiful fragment from
  some Sibylline poetry, but when, or by whom composed, is uncertain. The
  verses are taken notice of by Clemens Alexandrinus, and what is
  remarkable, are certainly quoted long before the completion of what is
  portended. However the purport may perhaps be looked upon rather as a
  menace, than a prophecy.</p>

  <p>The Deity was likewise called Achad, and Achon: and many cities and
  countries were hence <a name="footnotetag325"
  href="#footnote325"><sup>[325]</sup></a>denominated. Acon in Palestine is
  said to have been so named in honour of Hercules, the chief Deity in
  those <a name="footnotetag326"

  <p>I have mentioned, that Ham, styled also Cham, was looked up to as the
  Sun, and worshipped by his posterity. Hence both his images and priests
  were styled Chamin: and many princes assumed this title, just as they did
  that of Orus, and Arez. His posterity esteemed themselves of the Solar
  race, by way of eminence: and the great founder of the Persic Monarchy
  was styled Achamin, rendered by the Greeks <span title="Achaimenês" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C7;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>,
  Achæmenes: and all of his family afterwards had the title of <span
  title="Achaimenioi" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C7;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>,
  and <span title="Achaimenidai" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C7;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>,
  from the same pretensions. They all of them universally esteemed
  themselves the children of the Sun; though they were likewise so called
  from their worship. Hence Lutatius Placidus in his Scholia upon Statius
  interprets the word Achæmenidæ by <a name="footnotetag327"
  href="#footnote327"><sup>[327]</sup></a>Solis Cultores. This may serve to
  authenticate my etymology, and shew, that the term is derived from Cham,
  the Sun: but the purport of it was generally more limited, and the title
  confined to the royal race of the Persians, who were looked upon as the
  offspring of the Sun. The Cuthites of Ethiopia Africana had the same high
  opinion of themselves: hence Calasiris in Heliodorus invokes the Sun as
  his great ancestor. <a name="footnotetag328"

  <p>The term <span title="Uk" class="grk">&#x3A5;&#x3BA;</span>, of which
  I have been treating, was obsolete, and scarce known in the times when
  Greece most flourished: yet some traces of it may be found, though
  strangely perverted from its original meaning. For the writers of this
  nation, not knowing the purport of the words, which they found in their
  antient hymns, changed them to something similar in sound; and thus
  retained them with a degree of religious, but blind reverence. I have
  shewn, that of El-Uc they formed <span title="Lukos" class="grk"
  >&#x39B;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Lucus, which was
  acknowledged to be the name of the Sun: of El-Uc-Aon, Lycaon: of
  El-Uc-Or, Lycorus, and Lycoreus:</p>

  <p>The only person who seems knowingly to have retained this word, and to

  a degree of enthusiasm; and introduced them at all hazards, though he
  many times did not know their meaning. This word, among others, he has

  <p>In these and in all other instances of this term occurring in Homer,
  it is observable, that it is always in the same acceptation, and
  uniformly precedes the same word, <span title="aristos" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. It is indeed
  to be found in the poetry ascribed to <a name="footnotetag343"
  href="#footnote343"><sup>[343]</sup></a>Orpheus: but as those verses are
  manifestly imitations of Homer, we must not look upon it as a current
  term of the times, when that poetry was composed: nor was it ever, I
  believe, in common use, not even in the age of Homer. It was an Amonian
  term, joined inseparably with another borrowed from the same people. For
  <span title="aristos" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> was from Egypt,
  and Chaldea. Indeed, most of the irregular degrees of comparison are from
  that quarter; being derived from the Sun, the great Deity of the Pagan
  world, and from his titles and properties. Both <span title="areiôn" class="grk"

<h4>PHI.</h4>

  <p>Phi signifies a mouth; also language, and speech. It is used by the
  Amonians particularly for the voice and oracle of any God; and subjoined
  to the name of that Deity. The chief oracle in the first ages was that of
  Ham, who was worshipped as the Sun, and styled El, and Or. Hence these
  oracles are in consequence called Amphi, Omphi, Alphi, Elphi, Urphi,
  Orphi. It is made to signify, in the book of <a name="footnotetag344"
  href="#footnote344"><sup>[344]</sup></a>Genesis, the voice, or command of
  Pharaoh. From Phi, in this acceptation, came <span title="phêmi, phêmê, phêmus, phaskô, phatis" class="grk"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;, &#x3C6;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;,
  &#x3C6;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;, &#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3BA;&#x3C9;,
  &#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, fama, fari,&mdash;ita farier
  infit. I imagine that the term Pharaoh itself is compounded of Phi-Ourah,
  Vox Ori, sive Dei. It was no unusual thing among the antients to call the
  words of their prince the voice of God. Josephus informs us, that it
  signified a king: <a name="footnotetag345"
  href="#footnote345"><sup>[345]</sup></a><span title="Ho Pharaôn par' Aiguptiois basilea sêmainei" class="grk"
  >&#x1F49; &#x3A6;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;'
  &#x391;&#x3B9;&#x3B3;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;
  &#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;
  &#x3C3;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;</span>: and Ouro
  in the Copto-Arabic Onomasticon is said to signify the same: but I should
  think, that this was only a secondary acceptation of the original
  term.</p>

  <p>Phi is also used for any opening or cavity: whence we find the head of
  a fountain often denominated from it; at least the place, whence the
  fountain issued forth, or where it lost itself. And as all streams were
  sacred, and all cavities in the earth looked upon with a religious
  horror, the Amonians called them Phi-El, Phi-Ainon, Phi-Anes; rendered by
  the Greeks Phiale, Phænon, Phanes, Phaneas, Paneas. The chief fountain of
  the river Jordan lost itself underground, and rose again at some miles
  distance. It sunk at Phiale, and rose again at <a name="footnotetag346"
  href="#footnote346"><sup>[346]</sup></a>Paneas. Pliny speaks of a place
  of this sort at <a name="footnotetag347"
  href="#footnote347"><sup>[347]</sup></a>Memphis, called Phiala; and, as
  he imagines, from its figure: but it was undoubtedly a covert aquæduct,
  by which some branch of the river was carried. The Nile itself is said to
  be lost underground, near its fountains; and that place also was called
  Phiala. <a name="footnotetag348"
  href="#footnote348"><sup>[348]</sup></a>Phialam appellari fontem ejus,
  mergique in cuniculos ipsum amnem. There was also a fountain of this name
  at <a name="footnotetag349"
  href="#footnote349"><sup>[349]</sup></a>Constantinople. Sometimes it
  occurs without the aspirate, as in Pella, a city of Palestine, named,
  undoubtedly, from its fountains: for Pliny calls it Pellam aquis <a
  name="footnotetag350"
  href="#footnote350"><sup>[350]</sup></a>divitem.</p>

  <p>Mines were held sacred; and, like fountains, were denominated from
  Ænon, and Hanes, those titles of the Sun. In Arabia, near Petra, was a
  mine, worked by condemned persons, which was named <a
  name="footnotetag351" href="#footnote351"><sup>[351]</sup></a>Phinon, and
  Phænon. Epiphanius mentions <a name="footnotetag352"
  href="#footnote352"><sup>[352]</sup></a><span title="Phanêsia metalla" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;
  &#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;</span>, or the mines of
  Hanes; to which Meletius, a bishop of the Thebaïs, was condemned.</p>

<h4>AI.</h4>

  <p>Ai, and Aia, signifies a district or province; and, as most provinces
  in Egypt were insular, it is often taken for an island. In other parts it
  was of much the same purport as <span title="aia" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> of the Greeks, and betokened any <a
  name="footnotetag353" href="#footnote353"><sup>[353]</sup></a>region or
  country. It was from hence that so many places have been represented by
  the Greeks as plurals, and are found to terminate in <i>ai</i>; such as
  Athenai, Thebai, Pherai, Patrai, Amyclai, Therapnai, Clazomenai, Celænai.
  There are others in <i>eia</i>; as Chæroneia, Coroneia, Eleia. In others
  it was rendered short; as in Oropia, Ellopia, Ortygia, Olympia, Æthiopia,
  Scythia, Cænia, Icaria. It is likewise found expressed by a single
  letter, and still subjoined to the proper name: hence we meet with Ætna,
  Arbela, Larissa, Roma, Himera, Hemera, Nusa, Nyssa, Patara, Arena, <a
  name="footnotetag354" href="#footnote354"><sup>[354]</sup></a>Cabasa, and
  the like. We may from hence prove, and from innumerable other instances,
  that among the people of the east, as well as among other nations, the
  word in regimine was often final. Thus the land of Ion was termed Ionia;
  that of Babylon, Babylonia; from Assur came Assyria; from Ind, India;
  from Lud, Ludia; in all which the region is specified by the termination.
  To say Lydia tellus, Assyria tellus, is in reality <a
  name="footnotetag355" href="#footnote355"><sup>[355]</sup></a>redundant.
  In the name of Egypt this term preceded, that country being styled
  Ai-Gupt, <span title="Aiguptos" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B9;&#x3B3;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, the
  land of the Gupti, called afterwards Cupti, and Copti.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Common Names relating to Places.</font></h4>

  <p>As to the common names, which are found combined with additional
  terms, in order to denote the nature and situation of places; they are,
  for the most part, similar to those in the antient Chaldaic, and admit of
  little variation.</p>

  <p>Air is a city; often expressed Ar, and Ara. Hence Arachosia,
  Arachotus, Aracynthus, Arambis, Aramatha (Ar-Ham-aith), Archile, Arzilla,
  Arthedon: all which were cities, or else regions denominated from
  them.</p>

  <p>Kir, Caer, Kiriath, are words of the like purport. We read in the
  Scriptures of Kiriath Sepher, Kiriath Arba, Kiriath Jearim. It was in
  some parts pronounced Kirtha, and Cartha. Melicartus, the Hercules of the
  Phenicians and Cretans, was, properly, Melech-Carta, the Deity of the
  place. The city of Tigranes, in Armenia, was called Tigranocerta. One
  name of Carthage was <span title="Karchêdôn" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;&#x3B4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, from
  Car-Chadon, the same as Adon. It was also called Carthada, from
  Cartha-Ada, the city of the queen or Goddess, who was by the Romans
  supposed to be Juno, but was, properly, the Amonian Elisa. Caer, among
  many antient nations, signified a city, or fortress; as we may learn from
  the places called Carteia, Carnaim, Caronium, Caroura, Carambis. Among
  the Britons were, of old, places exactly analogous; such as Caerlisle,
  Caerdiff, Caerphilly, Caernarvon, and Caeruriah in Cornwall.</p>

  <p>Kir and Caer are the same term, differently expressed. In Scripture we
  meet with Kir Haresh, and Kir-Hareseth. Isaiah. c. 16. v. 7. and v. 11.
  and Kir Moab, c. 15. v. 1. and Kir Heres, of the same purport as Kir
  Haresh, is mentioned by Jeremiah, c. 48. v. 31. Upon the Euphrates was
  Cercusium and Carchemish. In Cyprus was Kironia, rendered <span
  title="Kerônia" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> by <a
  name="footnotetag356" href="#footnote356"><sup>[356]</sup></a>Ptolemy;
  whose true name was Kir-On, the city of the Sun; where was a temple to
  Our-Ain, styled Urania. Kir-On was often rendered Cironis, Coronis; and
  the Deity Coronus and <a name="footnotetag357"
  href="#footnote357"><sup>[357]</sup></a>Cronus. By these means the place
  was substituted for the Deity, and made an object of worship. Of this
  abuse I shall often speak. Artemis was, properly, a city, Ar-Themis, the
  same as Thamuz of Egypt. What was called Artemis, and Artemisium, was in
  some places reversed, and expressed by Kir subjoined: hence Themiscir,
  and Themiscura in Pontus.</p>

  <p>Col, Cal, Calah, Calach, signify properly an eminence, like the Collis
  of the Romans; but are often used for a fortress so situated. We
  sometimes meet with a place styled absolute Calah: but the term is
  generally used in composition, as Cala Nechus, Cala-Anac, Cala-Chan,
  Cala-On, Cala-Es, Cala-Ait, Cala-Ur, Cala-Ope, Cala-Ham, Cala-Amon,
  Cala-Adon: whence came the names of people and places styled <a
  name="footnotetag358" href="#footnote358"><sup>[358]</sup></a>Callinicus,
  Calachene, <a name="footnotetag359"
  href="#footnote359"><sup>[359]</sup></a>Colonæ, Cales, Calathe, Calistæ,
  Calathusa, Calauria, Coloriua, Caliope, Calama, Calamos, <a
  name="footnotetag360" href="#footnote360"><sup>[360]</sup></a>Calamon,
  Calymna, Calydnus, Calycadnus; all which were places in Phrygia,
  Bithynia, Assyria, Libya, denominated from their situation and
  worship.</p>

  <p>Comah is used for a wall; but seems to be sometimes taken for those
  sacred inclosures wherein they had their Puratheia; and particularly for
  the sacred mount which stood in those inclosures. From Comah came the
  Greek <span title="chôma" class="grk"
  >&#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;</span>, a round hill or mound of earth;
  called also Taph and <span title="taphos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; and thence often mistaken
  for a tomb: but it was originally a high altar.</p>

  <p>By Gib is meant a hill. Gibeon was the hill of the Sun; said to be
  famous for its springs. Gibethon is a compound of Gib-Ethon, or Ath-On,
  titles of the same Deity. Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, was slain by
  Baasha, at Gibethon, of the <a name="footnotetag361"
  href="#footnote361"><sup>[361]</sup></a>Philistines.</p>

  <p>Har and Hor signify a mountain; <span title="oros" class="grk"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> of the Greeks.</p>

  <p>Tin seems to have signified a sacred place, for sacrifice; a kind of
  high altar. The Greeks generally expressed it, in composition, <span
  title="Tis;" class="grk">&#x3A4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;&#x387;</span> hence we
  read of Opheltis, Altis, Baaltis, Abantis, Absyrtis. It was in use among
  the antient Hetrurians and other nations: hence came the terms Aventinus,
  Palatinus, <a name="footnotetag362"
  href="#footnote362"><sup>[362]</sup></a>Numantinus, &amp;c. It seems to
  be the same as Tan in the east, which occurs continually in composition,
  as in Indos-tan, Mogolis-tan, Pharsis-tan, Chusis-tan.</p>

  <p>Tor is a hill or tower. Many places in Greece had it in their
  composition; such as Torone, Torete, Toreate: also in Hetrurïa,
  Torchonium. Turzon, in Africa, was a tower of the <a
  name="footnotetag363" href="#footnote363"><sup>[363]</sup></a>Sun. It was
  sometimes expressed Tar; hence Tarcunia, Taracena, Tarracon in Spain,
  Tarne (Tar-ain) which gave name to a fountain in Lydia; Taron (Tar-On) in
  Mauritania. Towers of old were either Prutaneia, or light-houses, and
  were styled Tor-Is: whence came the Turris of the Romans. Sometimes these
  terms were reversed, and the tower was called Astur. Such a one was near
  some hot streams, at no great distance from Cicero's Villa. It is thus
  described by Plutarch: <span title="Astura&mdash;chôrion paralion Kikerônos" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&mdash;&#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x39A;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>.
  The river, too, was called Astura. There was also a place of this name
  opposite to the island Lesbos, undoubtedly denominated from the like
  circumstances in its situation; as may be learned from Pausanias, who had
  seen it. <span title="Hudôr de apo pêgôn anerchomenon melan idôn oida en Asturois; tade Astura apantikru esti Lesbou; loutra esti therma en tôi Atarnei kaloumenôi" class="grk"

  <p>Caph, Cap, and Cephas, signify a rock; and also any promontory or
  headland. As temples used to be built upon eminences of this sort; we
  find this word often compounded with the titles of the Deity there
  worshipped, as Caph-El, Caph-El-On, Caph-Aur, Caph-Arez, Caph-Is,
  Caph-Is-Ain, Caph-Ait; whence came Cephale, Cephalonia, Caphareus,
  Capisa, Cephisus, Capissene, Cephene, Caphyatæ, Capatiani. In Iberia was
  a wonderful edifice upon the river B&#339;tis, mentioned by Strabo, and
  called Turris Capionis. It was a Pharos, dedicated, as all such buildings
  were, to the Sun: hence it was named Cap-Eon, Petra Solis. It seems to
  have been a marvellous structure. Places of this sort, which had towers
  upon them, were called Caphtor. Such an one was in Egypt, or in its <a
  name="footnotetag364" href="#footnote364"><sup>[364]</sup></a>vicinity;
  whence the Caphtorim had their name. It was probably near <a
  name="footnotetag365" href="#footnote365"><sup>[365]</sup></a>Pelusium,
  which they quitted very early for the land of Canaan.</p>

  <p>Diu sometimes, but sparingly, occurs for an island; and is generally
  by the Greeks changed to Dia, <span title="Dia" class="grk"
  >&#x394;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>. The purport of it may be proved from its
  being uniformly adapted to the same object. The Scholiast upon Theocritus
  takes notice that the island Naxos was called Dia: <a
  name="footnotetag366" href="#footnote366"><sup>[366]</sup></a><span

  All these were islands, or peninsula regions.</p>

<h4>BETH.</h4>

  <p>Beth is a house or temple; as in <a name="footnotetag367"
  href="#footnote367"><sup>[367]</sup></a>Beth-El, Beth-Dagon,
  Beth-Shemesh, Beth-Oron, or Beth-Or-On, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is sometimes
  subjoined, as in Phar-beth, and Elisa-beth; the latter of which is the
  house of <a name="footnotetag368"
  href="#footnote368"><sup>[368]</sup></a>Elisa, the same as Elusa of
  Idume, and Eleusa of Egypt. Beth was in different countries expressed
  Bat, Bad, Abad. Hence we meet at this day with Pharsabad, Astrabad,
  Amenabad, Moustafabad, Iahenabad in Persia, India, and other parts of the
  east. Balbec in Syria is supposed to be the same as Balbeth, the temple
  of Bal, or the Sun. <i>There are</i>, says <a name="footnotetag369"
  href="#footnote369"><sup>[369]</sup></a>Dr. Pocock, <i>many cities in
  Syria, that retain their antient names. Of this Balbeck, or rather
  Balbeit, is an instance; which signifies the house or temple of Baal</i>.
  Gulielmus Tyrius, so called from being bishop of Tyre, who wrote of the
  Holy war, alludes to Baalbec, under the name of <a name="footnotetag370"
  href="#footnote370"><sup>[370]</sup></a>Balbeth. He lived in the eleventh
  century, and died anno 1127. According to Iablonsky, Bec and Beth are of
  the same meaning. Atarbec in Egypt is the temple of Atar or Athar; called
  Atarbechis by <a name="footnotetag371"
  href="#footnote371"><sup>[371]</sup></a>Herodotus. The same is Athyr-bet,
  and styled Athribites (<span title="Athreibitês" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B8;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B2;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>)
  by <a name="footnotetag372"
  href="#footnote372"><sup>[372]</sup></a>Strabo. The inner recess of a
  temple is by Phavorinus and Hesychius called <span title="Baitês" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>, <span title="Betês" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>, <span title="Betis" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, similar to <span lang="he"
  title="BYT ASH" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D1;&#x5D9;&#x5EA;
  &#x5D0;&#x5E9;</bdo></span> among the Chaldeans. It was the crypta or
  sacred place, where of old the everlasting fire was preserved. Hesychius
  observes, <span title="Betês, to apokruphon meros tou Hierou" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;, &#x3C4;&#x3BF;
  &#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;
  &#x1F39;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>. Bet-Is signifies the place
  of fire.</p>

  <p>It is said of Horapollo by Suidas, that he was a native of Phainubuth
  in Egypt, belonging to the nome of Panopolis: <span title="Hôrapollôn Phainubutheôs kômês tou Panopolitou Nomou." class="grk"
  >&#x1F69;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;

  &#x39D;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;.</span> Phainubuth is only Phainabeth
  varied, and signifies the place sacred to Phanes; which was one of the
  most antient titles of the Deity in Egypt. So Pharbeth was an
  abbreviation of Pharabeth, or the house of Pharaoh.</p>

<h4>GAU, expressed CAU, CA, and CO.</h4>

  <p>Gau likewise is a term which signifies a house; as we learn from
  Plutarch. The great and decisive battle between Alexander and Darius is
  generally said to have been fought at Arbela. But we are assured by this
  writer, that it was decided at Gaugamela<a name="footnotetag373"
  href="#footnote373"><sup>[373]</sup></a>. He says, that Gau signified in
  the language of the country a house: and that the purport of the word
  Gaugamela was the house of a camel. This name, it seems, was given to the
  town on account of a tribute exacted for the maintenance of a camel,
  which had saved the life of some king, when he fled from battle: and the
  reason why the victory of Alexander was adjudged to Arbela, arose from
  its being more famous than the other place: for Gaugamela was not of
  sufficient repute: therefore the honour of this victory was given to
  Arbela, though it was according to some five hundred, according to others
  six hundred stadia<a name="footnotetag374"
  href="#footnote374"><sup>[374]</sup></a> from the field of battle. I have
  not now time, nor is it to my purpose, to enter into a thorough
  discussion of this point: I will only mention it as my opinion, that
  Arbela and Gaugamela were the same place. The king alluded to is said by
  <a name="footnotetag375" href="#footnote375"><sup>[375]</sup></a>Strabo
  to have been Darius the son of Hystaspes. But is it credible, that so
  great a prince, who had horses of the famous breed of Nysa, as well as
  those of Persis and Arabia, the most fleet of their kind, should be so
  circumstanced in battle, as to be forced to mount a camel, that could
  scarce move six miles in an hour: and this at a time when the greatest
  dispatch was necessary? This author gives a different reason for the
  place being thus denominated. He says, that it was allotted for the
  maintenance of a camel, which used to bring the king's provisions from
  Scythia, but was tired and failed upon the road. I know not which of the
  two circumstances in this short detail is most exceptionable; a king of
  Persia's provisions being brought to Babylon, or Sushan from Scythia; or
  a tired camel having such a pension. The truth is this: the Grecians
  misinterpreted the name, and then forged these legendary stories to
  support their <a name="footnotetag376"
  href="#footnote376"><sup>[376]</sup></a>mistake. Had they understood the
  term, they would have been consistent in their history. Gau, and, as it
  was at times expressed, Cau, certainly signifies a house, or temple: also
  a cave, or hollow; near which the temple of the Deity was founded. For
  the Amonians erected most of their sacred edifices near caverns, and deep
  openings of the earth. Gaugamela was not the house of a camel, as
  Plutarch and Strabo would persuade us, notwithstanding the stories
  alleged in support of the notion: but it was the house and temple of
  Cam-El, the Deity of the country. Arbela was a place sacred to Bel,
  called Arbel, <span lang="he" title="AWR BL" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5E8; &#x5D1;&#x5DC;</bdo></span> of the
  Chaldeans. It was the same as Beth Arbel of <a name="footnotetag377"
  href="#footnote377"><sup>[377]</sup></a>Hosea: and Gaugamela is of the
  same purport, relating to the same God under different titles. The
  Grecians were grossly ignorant in respect to foreign events, as Strabo
  repeatedly confesses: and other writers do not scruple to own it.
  Lysimachus had been an attendant upon Alexander during the whole series
  of his conquests in Asia: there had been nothing of moment transacted, in
  the success of which he had not partaken. Yet even in his days, when he
  was king of Thrace, the accounts of those great actions had been so
  misrepresented, that when a history of them was read in his presence,
  they seemed quite new to him. It is all very fine, says the prince; but
  where was I when all this happened? There was a series of events
  exhibited, with which the person most interested was least acquainted. We
  may then well imagine, that there existed in the time of Plutarch many
  mistakes, both in respect to the geography of countries very remote, and
  to the <a name="footnotetag378"
  href="#footnote378"><sup>[378]</sup></a>language of nations, with whom
  the Romans were little acquainted. The great battle, of which we have
  been speaking, was confessedly fought at Gaugamela. Ptolemy Ceraunus, who
  was present, averred it: as did Aristobulus: and it has been recorded by
  Plutarch and others. It is also adjudged to Arbela by persons of equal
  credit: and it must certainly have been really there transacted: for
  notwithstanding the palliating excuse of Plutarch, it is utterly
  incredible in respect to so great a victory, that the scene of action
  should be determined by this place, if it were sixty, or, as some say,
  seventy miles out of the way. But in reality it was at no such distance.
  Diodorus Siculus says, that Alexander immediately after the victory
  attacked Arbela, and took it: and found in it many evidences of its being
  a place of consequence. <a name="footnotetag379"

  <p>I have mentioned, that Gaugamela was the temple of Cham-El, or
  Cham-Il. This was a title of the Deity brought from Chaldea to Egypt; and
  from thence to Greece, Hetruria, and other regions. The Greeks, out of
  different titles, and combinations, formed various Deities; and then
  invented different degrees of relation, which they supposed to have
  subsisted between them. According to Acusilaus Cham-Il was the Son of
  Vulcan, and Cabeira. <a name="footnotetag380"

  and supposes that Camillus had the name of Hermes from the similarity of
  his office, which was waiting upon the Gods. But the Chaldeans and
  Egyptians, from whom these titles were borrowed, esteemed Hermes as the
  chief Deity, the same as Zeus, Bel, and Adon. They knew nothing of
  Mercurius pedissequus, nor Hermes the lacky. They styled their chief God
  Cam-Il, or Camillus, and his priests had the same title. He did not
  borrow it from them; but they received it from him. The name is sometimes
  expressed Camulus: and the Amonians, who travelled westward, brought his
  rites and worship into the western parts of Europe: hence there are
  inscriptions to be found inscribed <a name="footnotetag384"
  href="#footnote384"><sup>[384]</sup></a>Camulo Sancto Fortissimo. He was

  <p>Such is the history of this Deity; whose worship was better known in
  the more early ages; and whose temple was styled Gau-Camel, by the Greeks
  rendered Gaugamela. I make no doubt but that Arbela was the same place:
  for places had as many names as the Deity worshipped had titles. Arbela
  was probably the city, and Gaugamela the <a name="footnotetag386"

  Deity, under different names.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that Syncellus, speaking of Venephres, King of Egypt,
  says, that he built the pyramids of <a name="footnotetag387"
  href="#footnote387"><sup>[387]</sup></a>Co-Chone; which are the principal
  pyramids of that country. Eusebius before him had taken notice of the

  was a prince, in whose time happened a famine in the land of Egypt. He
  was the same, who built the Pyramids about Cochone</i>. Now Co-Chone,
  analogous to Beth-El, Beth-Shan, Beth-Dagon, signifies the temple of the
  Deity; the house of the great king, or ruler: for such is the purport of
  Con, and Conah. Hercules, the chief Deity of Tyre, and who was also
  highly reverenced in Egypt, was Styled Con. <a name="footnotetag389"

  &#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>. From
  hence we find, that it was a sacred Egyptian title. According to some
  readings the place is expressed Cocome; which is of the same purport.
  Co-Chome, the same as Cau-Come, signifies the house of Chom, or the Sun;
  and seems to betray the purpose for which the chief pyramid was erected:
  for it was undoubtedly nothing else but a monument to the Deity, whose
  name it bore. According to <a name="footnotetag390"
  href="#footnote390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> Herodotus the great pyramid was
  built by Cheops; whom others called Chaops. But Chaops is a similar
  compound; being made up of the terms Cha-Ops, and signifies <span
  title="oikos Puthônos" class="grk">&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x3A0;&#x3C5;&#x3B8;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, domus Opis
  Serpentis. It was the name of the pyramid, which was erected to the Sun,
  the Ophite Deity of Egypt, worshipped under the symbol of a serpent.
  Analogous to Cau-Come in Egypt was a place in Ethiopia, called <a
  name="footnotetag391" href="#footnote391"><sup>[391]</sup></a>Cuscha:
  doubtless so named from Chus, the great ancestor from whom the Ethiopians
  were descended.</p>

  <p>The Sun was styled by the Amonians, among other titles, Zan; as I have
  before shewn: and he was worshipped under this denomination all over
  Syria and Mesopotamia; especially at Emesa, Edessa, and Heliopolis. One
  region was named Gauzanitis, from a city Gauzan, the Gosan of the <a
  name="footnotetag392" href="#footnote392"><sup>[392]</sup></a>Scriptures.
  Strabo calls it <a name="footnotetag393"
  href="#footnote393"><sup>[393]</sup></a><span title="Chazênê" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>, Cha-Zene, and places
  it near Adiabene. Gauzan, or Go-zan, is literally the house of the Sun. I
  once thought that the land of Goshen, in Egypt, was of the same purport
  as Cushan; and have so mentioned it in a former <a name="footnotetag394"
  href="#footnote394"><sup>[394]</sup></a>treatise. So far is true: the
  land of Goshen was the land of Cushan, and possessed by the sons of Chus:
  but the two terms are not of the same meaning. Goshen, or Goshan, like
  Gauzan in Mesopotamia, signifies the temple of the Sun: hence it was as a
  city, rendered by the Greeks Heliopolis. Artapanus, as we learn from
  Eusebius, expresses it Caisan, <span title="Kaisan" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>. Go-Shan, Gau Zan,
  Caisan, Cazena, all denote a place sacred to the Sun; and are such
  variations in rendering the same term, as must be expected in an interval
  of fifteen hundred years, and from different transcribers. This luminary
  was also called Abor, the parent of light; and his temple Cha-Abor, and
  Cho-Abor, contracted Chabor and Chobar. Of this name both a city and
  river were to be found in Gauzanitis; as well as in Susiana, and other
  parts: for rivers often took their names from some temple, or city, by
  which they ran. The temple at Dodona was, of old, called Cha-On, or house
  of the Sun; as we may infer from the country having the name of Chaonia;
  for Chaonia is the land of Chaon. The priests and inhabitants were called
  <a name="footnotetag395" href="#footnote395"><sup>[395]</sup></a>Chaones,
  from their place of worship: and the former had also the name<a
  name="footnotetag396" href="#footnote396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> of Selli,
  which signifies the priests of the Sun. In Arcadia, near the eruption of
  the river Erasinus, was a mountain, clothed with beautiful trees, and
  sacred to Dionusus. This, also, was called <a name="footnotetag397"
  href="#footnote397"><sup>[397]</sup></a>Chaon, <i>the place of the
  Sun</i>; and was, undoubtedly, so named from the antient worship; for
  Dionusus was, of old, esteemed the same as Osiris, the Sun. There was
  also a place called <a name="footnotetag398"
  href="#footnote398"><sup>[398]</sup></a>Chaon in Media and Syria;
  Chaonitis in Mesopotamia: and in all these places the same worship
  prevailed. So Caballis, the city of the Solymi, was named from Ca-bal,
  the place of the god Bal, or Baal. It is mentioned by Strabo. In like
  manner Caballion, in Gallia Narbonensis, is a compound of Ca-Abelion, a
  well known Deity, whose name is made up of titles of the Sun. The priests
  of this place were styled <a name="footnotetag399"
  href="#footnote399"><sup>[399]</sup></a>Salies; the region was called
  <span title="Chaouara" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>; undoubtedly
  from Cha-Our (<span lang="he" title="AWR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>), some temple of Ur, erected
  by the Amonians, who here settled. Canoubis in Egypt was a compound of
  Ca-Noubis; Cabasa, in the same country, Ca-Basa; called by many Besa, the
  Beseth of the Scriptures, a Goddess well known in Egypt. She had a temple
  in Canaan, called <a name="footnotetag400"
  href="#footnote400"><sup>[400]</sup></a>Beth Besa. Cuamon, near
  Esdraelon, is a compound of Cu-Amon, the place or house of Amon: <a
  name="footnotetag401" href="#footnote401"><sup>[401]</sup></a><span

  Pausanias supposes that the name was given from <span title="Kuamos" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Cuamos, a bean. <a

  &#x1F41;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. <i>I have not authority for
  the supposition, but it seems probable that this temple was erected to
  the memory of some person who first sowed beans</i>. And here it is
  proper to take notice of a circumstance of which I must continually put
  the reader in mind, as it is of great consequence towards decyphering the
  mythology of antient times. The Grecians often mistook the place of
  worship for the Deity worshipped: so that the names of many Gods are, in
  reality, the names of temples where they were adored. Artemis was
  Ar-Temis, the city of Themis, or Thamis; the Thamuz of Sidon and Egypt.
  This the Greeks expressed <span title="Artemis" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C1;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>; and made it
  the name of a Goddess. Kir-On was the city and temple of the Sun, in
  Cyprus and other places. They changed this to Kironus, which they
  contracted Cronus; and out of it made a particular God. From Cha-Opis
  they formed a king Cheops; from Cayster, the same as Ca Aster, they
  fancied a hero, Caystrius; from Cu-Bela, Cybele; from Cu-Baba, Cybebe.
  Cerberus, the dog of hell, was denominated from Kir-Abor; as I shall
  hereafter <a name="footnotetag403"
  href="#footnote403"><sup>[403]</sup></a>shew.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned Caucon, or Caucone, in Egypt: there was a place of
  the same name in Greece. It was, originally, sacred to the Sun; and the
  priests and inhabitants were called Cancones. Instead of Con, which
  signifies the great Lord, the Greeks substituted a hero <a
  name="footnotetag404" href="#footnote404"><sup>[404]</sup></a>Caucon, who
  was supposed to have first introduced those Orgies practised by the
  Messenians. It was, properly, a temple of the Sun; and there was another
  of the same name in Bithynia, and from thence the country was called
  Cauconia. I shall hereafter treat at large of Cuthite colonies, which
  went abroad and settled in different parts. One of the first operations
  when they came on shore was to build temples, and to found cities, in
  memory of their principal ancestors, who, in process of time, were
  worshipped as Deities. A colony of this people settled at Colchis, which
  they called Cutaia<a name="footnotetag405"
  href="#footnote405"><sup>[405]</sup></a>, from the head of their family,
  styled both Chus and Cuth. We may infer, that they built a temple which
  was called Ca-Cuta; and from which the region was also denominated: for
  it is certain that it has that name at this <a name="footnotetag406"
  href="#footnote406"><sup>[406]</sup></a>day. Cocutus, which we render
  Cocytus, was undoubtedly a temple in Egypt. It gave name to a stream, on
  which it stood; and which was also called the Charonian branch of the
  Nile, and the river Acheron. It was a foul canal, near the place of
  Sepulture, opposite to Memphis, and not far from Cochone. Cocutus was the
  temple of Cutus, or Cuth; for he was so called by many of his posterity.
  A temple of the same was to be found in Epirus, upon a river Cocutus.
  Here was also a river Acheron, and a lake Acherusia: for a colony from
  Egypt settled here; and the stream was of as foul a nature as that near
  Memphis. <a name="footnotetag407"

  href="#footnote408"><sup>[408]</sup></a>Dies quinque te kalo, Juno
  Covella; Juno Covella, dies septem te kalo. Here, as in many instances,
  the place of worship is taken for the person, to whom the worship is
  directed. Covella is only a variation for Cou-El, or Co-El, the house or
  region of the Deity, and signifies heavenly. It is accordingly by Varro
  interpreted Urania, <span title="Ourania" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>: whence Juno
  Covella must be rendered C&#339;lestis. From the substantive, Cou-El, the
  Romans formed Coel, heaven; in aftertimes expressed Coelus, and
  C&#339;lum. I say, in aftertimes: for they originally called it Co-el,
  and Co-il, and then contracted it to C&#339;l. Hence Ausonius in his
  Grammaticomastix mentions a passage to this purpose.</p>

  he alludes, has rendered it, according to the present MSS. altisonum <a

  href="#footnote411"><sup>[411]</sup></a>Athenagoras, and said to have
  been worshipped at Athens, was the same as the above.</p>

  <p>Many places and regions, held sacred, and called Coel by the Amonians,
  were by the Greeks rendered <span title="koila" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;</span>, cava. Hence we read of <span
  title="Koilê Lakedaimôn" class="grk">&#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;
  &#x39B;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>,

  &#x397;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;,</span> and the like. Syria was by them
  styled <span title="Koilê" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;</span>, the hollow: but the true
  name was Coëla, the heavenly or sacred. It was so denominated from the
  Cuthites, who settled there, on account of the religion established.
  Hence it was also named Shem, and Shama; which are terms of like purport,
  and signify divine, or heavenly. It is a name, which it retains at this
  day; as we are informed by <a name="footnotetag412"
  href="#footnote412"><sup>[412]</sup></a>Abulfeda, and others. Elis Coela
  was the most sacred part of Greece; especially the regions of Olympia,
  Cauconia, and Azania. It was denominated Elis from <span title="Êl" class="grk"
  >&#x397;&#x3BB;</span>, Eel, the Sun: and what the Greeks rendered <span
  title="Koilê" class="grk">&#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;</span> of
  old meant <a name="footnotetag413"
  href="#footnote413"><sup>[413]</sup></a>heavenly. Hence Homer styleth it
  peculiarly <a name="footnotetag414"
  href="#footnote414"><sup>[414]</sup></a><span title="Êlida dian" class="grk"
  >&#x397;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B1; &#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>,
  <i>Elis the sacred</i>. As Coele Syria was styled Sham, and Sama; so we
  find places, which have a reference to this term, in Elis. A town of
  great antiquity was named <a name="footnotetag415"
  href="#footnote415"><sup>[415]</sup></a>Samicon, which signifies
  C&#339;li Dominus. Here was also a temple of Poseidon Samius, surrounded
  with a grove of olives; and there were festivals observed, which were
  called Samia. There was likewise of old a city named Sama, or Samos:
  which Strabo imagines, might have been so named from its high situation:
  <i>for high places were called <a name="footnotetag416"
  href="#footnote416"><sup>[416]</sup></a>Samia</i>. It certainly signifies
  in some degree high; but the true meaning of Sama was heavenly, similar
  to Sam, Sham, Shamem, of the eastern nations. Hence Same, Samos,
  Samothrace, Samacon, were denominated on account of their sanctity.
  Strabo supposes, that the city Samos in Elis was situated in the Samian
  plain: it therefore could not well have this name from its high
  situation. It is moreover inconsistent to suppose regions called <span
  title="koila" class="grk">&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;</span>, or
  cava, to have been denominated from Sama, high. In short both terms have
  been mistaken: and Coilus in the original acceptation certainly signified
  heavenly: whence we read in Hesychius, as also in Suidas, <span
  title="Koiolês, ho Hiereus" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;, &#x1F41;
  &#x1F39;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>. By which we learn,
  that by Coioles was meant a sacred or heavenly person; in other words, a
  priest of C&#339;lus. In Coioles there is but a small variation from the
  original term; which was a compound from Coi-El, or Co-El, the C&#339;lus
  of the Romans.</p>

  <p>Concerning the term C&#339;l in Ennius, <a name="footnotetag417"
  href="#footnote417"><sup>[417]</sup></a>Janus Gulielmus takes notice,
  that this poet copied the Dorians in using abbreviations, and writing
  C&#339;l for C&#339;lus and C&#339;lum. But herein this learned person is
  mistaken. The Dorians were not so much to be blamed for their
  abbreviating, as the other Greeks were for their unnecessary
  terminations, and inflexions. The more simple the terms, the more antient
  and genuine we may for the most part esteem them: and in the language of
  the Dorians we may perceive more terms relative to the true mythology of
  the country, and those rendered more similar to the antient mode of
  expression, than are elsewhere to be found. We must, therefore, in all
  etymological inquiries, have recourse to the Doric manner of
  pronunciation, to obtain the truth. They came into Greece, or Hellotia,
  under the name of Adorians; and from their simplicity of manners, and
  from the little intercourse maintained with foreigners, they preserved
  much of their antient tongue. For this there may be another additional
  reason obtained from Herodotus; who tells us, that they were more
  immediately descended from the people of the <a name="footnotetag418"
  href="#footnote418"><sup>[418]</sup></a>east. The antient hymns, sung in
  the Prutaneia all over Greece, were <a name="footnotetag419"
  href="#footnote419"><sup>[419]</sup></a>Doric: so sacred was their
  dialect esteemed. Hence they cannot but afford great help in inquiries of
  this nature. What was by others styled <span title="Athênê" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B8;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>, they expressed <span
  title="Athana" class="grk">&#x391;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>:
  Cheops they rendered Chaops: Zeen, Zan: <span title="Chazênê" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>, <span title="Chazana" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>: <span title="Mên" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;</span>, <span title="Man" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>: Menes, Manes: Orchenoi, Orchanoi: Neith,
  Naith: <span title="Iênisos" class="grk"

  title="Ianisos" class="grk"
  >&#x399;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>: Hephæstus,
  Hephastus: Caiete, Caiate: Demeter, Damater: all which will be found of
  great consequence in respect to etymology. And if they did not always
  admit of the terminations used by their neighbours: they by these means
  preserved many words in their primitive state: at least they were nearer
  to the originals. They seem to have retained the very term, of which I
  have been treating. It was by them styled <span title="Chai" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>, Cai; and signified a house, or cave: for
  the first houses in the infancy of the world are supposed to have been
  caves or grottos<a name="footnotetag420"
  href="#footnote420"><sup>[420]</sup></a>. They expressed it Cai, Caia,
  Caias, similar to the cava, cavus, and cavea of the Romans. When these
  places were of a great depth, or extent, they were looked upon with a
  kind of religious horror. A cavern of this sort was at Lacedæmon, with a
  building over it; of which in aftertimes they made use to confine
  malefactors. It was called <span title="Kaiadês" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>, or as the
  Spartans expressed it, <span title="Kaiadas" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>, the house of
  death. <a name="footnotetag421"

  Cai signified a cavern: Adas, which is subjoined, was the Deity, to whom
  it was sacred, esteemed the God of the infernal regions. He was by the
  Ionians, &amp;c. expressed Ades, and Hades; and by other nations Ait, and
  Atis. Hence these caverns were also styled <span title="Kaietes" class="grk"

  Hesychius renders it in the plural, and as a neuter: <span title="kaiata" class="grk"

  The den of Cacus was properly a sacred cave, where Chus was worshipped,
  and the rites of fire were <a name="footnotetag423"
  href="#footnote423"><sup>[423]</sup></a>practised. Cacus is the same name
  as Cuscha in Ethiopia, only reversed. The history of it was obsolete in

  signified a person, who lived in a mountain habitation; whose retreat was
  a house in a mountain. Co, and Coa, was the name of such house. Strabo
  says that this term is alluded to by Homer, when he styles Lacedæmon <a
  name="footnotetag426" href="#footnote426"><sup>[426]</sup></a><span

  <i>for it was by many thought to have been so called on account of their
  caverns.</i> From hence we may fairly conclude, that <span
  title="kêtôessa" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3C3;&#x3B1;</span> was a

  from Cai-Atis; and that Co, <a name="footnotetag428"
  href="#footnote428"><sup>[428]</sup></a>Coa, Caia, were of the same
  purport.</p>

  <p>But this term does not relate merely to a cavern; but to temples
  founded near such places: oftentimes the cave itself was a temple.
  Caieta, in Italy, near Cuma, called by Diodorus <span title="Kaiêtê" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;</span>, was so denominated on
  this account. It was a cave in the rock, abounding with variety of
  subterranes, cut out into various apartments. These were, of old,
  inhabited by Amonian priests; for they settled in these parts very early.
  It seems to have been a wonderful work. <a name="footnotetag429"

  <i>In these parts were large openings in the earth, exhibiting caverns of
  a great extent; which afforded very ample and superb apartments.</i>
  Diodorus informs us, that, what was in his time called Caiete, had been
  sometimes styled <a name="footnotetag430"
  href="#footnote430"><sup>[430]</sup></a>Aiete: by which we may see, that
  it was a compound; and consisted of two or more terms; but these terms
  were not precisely applicable to the same object. Ai-Ete, or Ai-Ata, was
  the region of Ait, the Deity to whom it was sacred. Colchis had the same
  name; whence its king was called Aietes: and Egypt had the same,
  expressed by the Greeks <a name="footnotetag431"
  href="#footnote431"><sup>[431]</sup></a><span title="Aetia" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>, Aetia. Aiete was the
  district: Caiete was the cave and temple in that district; where the
  Deity was worshipped.</p>

  <p>In B&#339;otia was a cavern, into which the river Cephisus descended,
  and was lost. It afterwards emerged from this gulf, and passed freely to
  the sea. The place of eruption was called An-choa, which signifies Fontis
  apertura. The later Greeks expressed it Anchoe<a name="footnotetag432"

  <p>From Cho, and Choa, was probably derived the word <span

  signify any house. Some nations used it in a still more extended sense;
  and by it denoted a town or village, and any habitation at large. It is
  found in this acceptation among the antient Celtæ, and Germans, as we

  >&#x3A0;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Purgos, was properly
  Pur-Go; and signified a light-house, or temple of fire, from the Chaldaic
  Pur.</p>

<h4>PARTICLES.</h4>

  <p>Together with the words above mentioned are to be found in composition
  the particles Al and Pi. Al, or El, for it is differently expressed in
  our characters, is still an Arabian prefix; but not absolutely confined
  to that country, though more frequently there to be found. The Sun, <span
  lang="he" title="AWR" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>,
  was called Uchor by the people of Egypt and Cyrene, which the Greeks
  expressed <span title="Achôr" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;</span>, Achor. He was worshipped with the
  same title in Arabia, and called Al Achor. <a name="footnotetag435"
  href="#footnote435"><sup>[435]</sup></a>Georgius Monachus, describing the
  idolatry which prevailed in that country before the introduction of the
  present religion, mentions the idol Alachar. Many nations have both
  expletives and demonstratives analogous to the particle above. The
  pronoun Ille of the Romans is somewhat similar; as are the terms Le and
  La of the French; as well as Il and El in other languages. It is in
  composition so like to <span title="Êl" class="grk"
  >&#x397;&#x3BB;</span>, the name of <span title="Hêlios" class="grk"
  >&#x1F29;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, the Sun, that it is not
  always easy to distinguish one from the other.</p>

  <p>The article Pi was in use among the antient Egyptians and Cuthites, as
  well as other nations in the east. The natives of India were at all times
  worshippers of the Sun; and used to call themselves by some of his
  titles. Porus, with whom Alexander engaged upon the Indus, was named from
  the chief object of his worship, <span lang="he" title="AWR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>, Pi-Or, and P'Or; rendered
  by the Greeks <span title="Pôros" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Porus. Pacorus the Parthian
  was of the same etymology, being a compound of P'Achorus, the Achor of
  Egypt: as was also the <a name="footnotetag436"
  href="#footnote436"><sup>[436]</sup></a>city Pacoria in Mesopotamia,
  mentioned by Ptolemy. Even the Grecian <span title="pur" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;</span> was of Egyptian or Chaldaïc original, and
  of the same composition (P'Ur) as the words above; for <a
  name="footnotetag437" href="#footnote437"><sup>[437]</sup></a>Plato
  informs us that <span title="pur" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;</span>, <span title="hudôr" class="grk"

  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>, were esteemed terms of
  foreign importation. After the race of the Egyptian kings was extinct,
  and that country came under the dominion of the Grecians, the natives
  still continued to make use of this prefix; as did other <a
  name="footnotetag438" href="#footnote438"><sup>[438]</sup></a>nations
  which were incorporated with them. They adapted it not only to words in
  their own language, but to those of other countries of which they
  treated. Hence there is often to be found in their writings, <a

  Pitribunus; also names of persons occur with this prefix; such as
  Piterus, Piturio, Pionius the martyr; also Pior, Piammon, Piambo; who are
  all mentioned by ecclesiastical <a name="footnotetag440"
  href="#footnote440"><sup>[440]</sup></a>writers as natives of that
  country. This article is sometimes expressed Pa; as in the name of
  Pachomius, an abbot in Egypt, mentioned by <a name="footnotetag441"

  is to be found in the Excerpta from Antonius <a name="footnotetag442"

  particular rites, styled Pamylia Sacra, from <a name="footnotetag443"

  Hades, and Pi-Ades, was a common title of the Sun: and the latter, in
  early times, was current in Greece; where I hope to give ample testimony
  of the Amonians settling. He was termed Melech Pi-Adon, and Anac Pi-Adon:
  but the Greeks out of Pi-Adon formed <span title="Paidôn" class="grk"

  <i>The people of Amphissa perform a ceremony in honour of persons styled

  could the priests afford him any satisfactory information. There are many
  instances in Pausanias of this nature; where divine honours are paid to
  the unknown children of fathers equally unknown.</p>

  <p>Herodotus tells us, that, when he discoursed with the priests of
  Thebes about the kings who had reigned in Egypt, they described them to

  succeeded to those above, and were mere mortals. The manner of succession

  There are many strange and contradictory opinions about this <a
  name="footnotetag450" href="#footnote450"><sup>[450]</sup></a>passage;
  which, if I do not deceive myself, is very plain; and the purport of it
  this: <i>After the fabulous accounts, there had been an uninterrupted
  succession of Piromis after Piromis: and the Egyptians referred none of
  these to the dynasties of either the Gods or Heroes, who were supposed to
  have first possessed the country</i>. From hence I think it is manifest
  that Pi-romis signifies <i>a man</i>. Herodotus, indeed, says, that the
  meaning of it was <span title="kalos kagathos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, <i>a person of
  a fair and honourable character</i>: and so it might be taken by
  implication; as we say of a native of our own country, that he is a true
  and staunch <a name="footnotetag451"
  href="#footnote451"><sup>[451]</sup></a>Englishman: but the precise
  meaning is plain from the context; and Piromis certainly meant <i>a
  man</i>. It has this signification in the Coptic: and, in the <a
  name="footnotetag452" href="#footnote452"><sup>[452]</sup></a>Prodromus
  Copticus of Kircher, <span title="Pirômi" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3B9;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;</span>, Piromi, is <i>a
  man</i>; and seems to imply a native. Pirem Racot is an Alexandrine; or,
  more properly, a native of Racotis, called Raschid, and Rosetta. Pirem
  Romi are <a name="footnotetag453"
  href="#footnote453"><sup>[453]</sup></a>Romans.</p>

  <p>By means of this prefix we may be led to understand what is meant by
  Paraia in the account given by Philo from Sanchoniathon: who says, that
  Cronus had three sons in the region of Paraia: <a name="footnotetag454"

  &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;.</span> Paraia is a variation
  of P'Ur-aia; and means literally the land of Ur in Chaldea; the region
  from whence antient writers began the history of mankind. A crocodile by
  the Egyptians was among other names called <a name="footnotetag455"
  href="#footnote455"><sup>[455]</sup></a><span title="Souchos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A3;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>: and the name is
  retained in the Coptic, where it is expressed <a name="footnotetag456"
  href="#footnote456"><sup>[456]</sup></a>Pi-Souchi.</p>

  <p>This prefix is sometimes expressed with an aspirate, Phi: and as that
  word signifies a mouth, and in a more extensive signification, speech and
  language, it sometimes may cause a little uncertainty about the meaning.
  However, in most places it is sufficiently plain. Phaethon, a much
  mistaken personage, was an antient title of the Sun, a compound of
  Phi-Ath-On. Bacchus was called Phi-Anac by the Mysians, rendered by the
  poets <a name="footnotetag457"
  href="#footnote457"><sup>[457]</sup></a>Phanac and Phanaces. Hanes was a
  title of the same Deity, equally reverenced of old, and compounded Ph'
  Hanes. It signified the fountain of light: and from it was derived Phanes
  of Egypt: also <span title="phainô" class="grk"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;</span>, <span title="phaneis" class="grk"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, <span
  title="phaneros" class="grk"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>: and from
  Ph'ain On, Fanum. In short, these particles occur continually in words,
  which relate to religious rites, and the antient adoration of fire. They
  are generally joined to Ur, by which that element is denoted. From P'Ur
  Tor came Prætor and Prætorium, among the Romans: from P'Ur-Aith, Purathi
  and Puratheia among the Asiatics. From P'Ur-tan, <span title="prutaneis" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>,
  and <span title="prutaneia" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>
  among the Greeks of Hellas: in which Prutaneia there were of old sacred
  hearths, and a perpetual fire. The antient name of Latian Jupiter was
  P'ur, by length of time changed to Puer. He was the Deity of fire; and
  his ministers were styled Pueri: and because many of them were handsome
  youths selected for that office, Puer came at length to signify any young
  person. Some of the Romans would explain this title away, as if it
  referred to Jupiter's childhood: but the history of the place will shew
  that it had no such relation. It was a proper name, and retained
  particularly among the people of Præneste. They had undoubtedly been
  addicted to the rites of fire; for their city was said to have been built
  by Cæculus, the son of Vulcan, who was found in the midst of fire:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag458" href="#footnote458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> Vulcano genitum pecora inter agrestia Regem,</p>
      <p>Inventumque focis.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>They called their chief God Pur: and dealt particularly in divination
  by lots, termed of old <i>Purim</i>. Cicero takes notice of this custom
  of divination at Præneste; and describes the manner, as well as the
  place: but gives into the common mistake, that the Purim related to
  Jupiter's childhood. He says, that the place, where the process was
  carried on, was a sacred inclosure, <a name="footnotetag459"
  href="#footnote459"><sup>[459]</sup></a>is est hodie locus septus,
  religiose propter Jovis <i>Pueri</i>, qui lactens cum Junone in gremio
  <i>Fortunæ</i> mammam appetens, castissime colitur a Matribus. This
  manner of divination was of Chaldaïc original, and brought from Babylonia
  to Præneste. It is mentioned in Esther, c. 3. v. 7. They cast Pur before
  Haman, that he might know the success of his purposes against the Jews.
  <i>Wherefore they call these days Purim after the name of Pur</i><a
  name="footnotetag460" href="#footnote460"><sup>[460]</sup></a>. c. 9. v.
  26. The same lots of divination being used at Præneste was the occasion
  of the God being called Jupiter Pur. This in aftertimes was changed to
  Puer: whence we find inscriptions, which mention him under that name; and
  at the same time take notice of the custom, which prevailed in his
  temple. Inscriptions Jovi Puero, and Fortunæ Primigeniæ Jovis <a
  name="footnotetag461" href="#footnote461"><sup>[461]</sup></a>Pueri are
  to be found in Gruter. One is very particular.</p>

  <p>Many instances, were it necessary, might be brought to this purpose.
  It was a name originally given to the priests of the Deity who were named
  from the Chaldaic <span lang="he" title="AWR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>, Ur: and by the antient
  Latines were called P'uri. At Præneste the name was particularly kept up
  on account of this divination by <a name="footnotetag464"
  href="#footnote464"><sup>[464]</sup></a>lots. These by the Amonians were
  styled Purim, being attended with ceremonies by fire; and supposed to be
  effected through the influence of the Deity. Præneste seems to be a
  compound of Puren Esta, the lots of Esta, the Deity of fire.</p>

  <p>These are terms, which seem continually to occur in the antient
  Amonian history: out of these most names are compounded; and into these
  they are easily resolvable. There are some few more, which might perhaps
  be very properly introduced: but I am unwilling to trespass too far,
  especially as they may be easily taken notice of in the course of this
  work. I could wish that my learned readers would afford me so far credit,
  as to defer passing a general sentence, till they have perused the whole:
  for much light will accrue; and fresh evidence be accumulated in the
  course of our procedure. A history of the rites and religion, in which
  these terms are contained, will be given; also of the times, when they
  were introduced; and of the people, by whom they were diffused so widely.
  Many positions, which may appear doubtful, when they are first premised,
  will, I hope, be abundantly proved, before we come to the close. In
  respect to the etymologies, which I have already offered and considered,
  I have all along annexed the histories of the persons and places spoken
  of, in order to ascertain my opinion concerning them. But the chief
  proof, as I have before said, will result from the whole; from an uniform
  series of evidence, supported by a fair and uninterrupted analogy.</p>

  <p>It may appear invidious to call to account men of learning, who have
  gone before me in inquiries of this nature, and to point out defects in
  their writings: but it is a task which I must, in some degree, take in
  hand, as the best writers have, in my opinion, failed fundamentally in
  these researches. Many, in the wantonness of their fancy, have yielded to
  the most idle surmises; and this to a degree of licentiousness, for which
  no learning nor ingenuity can atone. It is therefore so far from being
  injurious, that it appears absolutely necessary to point out the path
  they took, and the nature of their failure; and this, that their
  authority may not give a sanction to their mistakes; but, on the
  contrary, if my method should appear more plausible, or more certain,
  that the superiority may be seen upon comparing; and be proved from the
  contrast.</p>

  <p>The Grecians were so prepossessed with a notion of their own
  excellence and antiquity, that they supposed every antient tradition to
  have proceeded from themselves. Hence their mythology is founded upon the
  grossest mistakes: as all extraneous history, and every foreign term, is
  supposed by them to have been of Grecian original. Many of their learned
  writers had been abroad; and knew how idle the pretensions of their
  countrymen were. Plato in particular saw the fallacy of their claim, he
  confesses it more than once: yet in this article nobody was more
  infatuated. His Cratylus is made up of a most absurd system of etymology.

  subjects to foreigners, have received into their language many exotic
  terms: if any person should be led to seek for their analogy or meaning
  in the Greek tongue, and not in the language from whence they proceeded,
  he would be grievously puzzled</i>. Who would think, when Plato
  attributed to Socrates this knowledge, that he would make him continually
  act in contradiction to it? Or that other <a name="footnotetag470"
  href="#footnote470"><sup>[470]</sup></a>writers, when this plain truth
  was acknowledged, should deviate so shamefully? that we should in after
  times be told, that Tarsus, the antient city in Cilicia, was denominated
  from <span title="tartos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, a foot: that the

  title="Gês deira" class="grk">&#x393;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;
  &#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>.</p>

  <p>The antients, in all their etymologies, were guided solely by the ear:
  in this they have been implicitly copied by the moderns. Inquire of
  Heinsius, whence Thebes, that antient city in upper Egypt, was named; and
  he will tell you from <span lang="he" title="TBA" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5EA;&#x5D1;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>, Teba, <a
  name="footnotetag471" href="#footnote471"><sup>[471]</sup></a>stetit: or
  ask the good bishop Cumberland why Nineve was so called? and he will
  answer, from Schindler, that it was a compound of <a
  name="footnotetag472" href="#footnote472"><sup>[472]</sup></a>Nin-Nau,
  <span lang="he" title="NIN NWH" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E0;&#x5D9;&#x5DF;
  &#x5E0;&#x5D5;&#x5D4;</bdo></span>, <i>a son inhabited</i>. But is it
  credible, or indeed possible, for these cities to have been named from
  terms so vague, casual, and indeterminate; which seem to have so little
  relation to the places to which they are appropriated, or to any places
  at all? The history of the Chaldeans is of great consequence; and one
  would be glad to know their original. They are properly called Chasdim;
  and are, very justly, thought to have been the first constituted nation
  upon earth. It is said of the patriarch Abraham, that he came from the
  city Ur of the Chasdim. Whence had they their name? The learned Hyde will
  <a name="footnotetag473" href="#footnote473"><sup>[473]</sup></a>answer,
  that it was from Chesed, their ancestor. Who was Chesed? He was the
  fourth son of Nahor, who lived in Aram, the upper region of Mesopotamia.
  Is it said in history that he was the father of this people? There is no
  mention made of it. Is it said that he was ever in Chaldea? No. Is there
  the least reason to think that he had any acquaintance with that country?
  We have no grounds to suppose it. Is there any reason to think that this
  people, mentioned repeatedly as prior to him by ages, were in reality
  constituted after him? None. What, then, has induced writers to suppose
  that he was the father of this people? Because Chesed and Chasdim have a
  remote similitude in sound. And is this the whole? Absolutely all that is
  or can be alleged for this notion. And as the Chasdim are mentioned some
  ages before the birth of Chesed, some would have the passage to be
  introduced proleptically; others suppose it an interpolation, and would
  strike it out of the sacred text: so far does whim get the better of
  judgment, that even the written word is not safe. The whole history of
  Chesed is this: About fifty years after the patriarch Abraham had left
  his brother Nahor at Haran in Aramea, he received intelligence that Nahor
  had in that interval been blessed with children. <a name="footnotetag474"
  href="#footnote474"><sup>[474]</sup></a><i>It was told Abraham, behold
  Milcah, she also hath borne children to thy brother Nahor; Huz, Buz,
  Kemuel, and Chesed:</i> of these Chesed was the fourth. There occurs not
  a word more concerning him.</p>

  <p>It is moreover to be observed, that these etymologists differ greatly
  from one another in their conceptions; so that an unexperienced reader
  knows not whom to follow. Some deduce all from the Hebrew; others call in
  to their assistance the Arabic and the Coptic, or whatever tongue or
  dialect makes most for their purpose. The author of the Universal
  History, speaking of the Moabitish Idol Chemosh, tells us, <a
  name="footnotetag475" href="#footnote475"><sup>[475]</sup></a><i>that
  many make it come from the verb <span lang="he" title="MSHSH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5E9;&#x5E9;</bdo></span>, mashash, to feel: but Dr.
  Hyde derives it from the Arabic, Khamûsh, which signifies gnats, (though
  in the particular dialect of the tribe Hodail) supposing it to have been
  an astronomical talisman in the figure of a gnat:&mdash;and Le Clerc, who
  takes this idol for the Sun, from Comosha, a root, in the same tongue,
  signifying to be swift.</i> There is the same variety of sentiment about
  Silenus, the companion of Bacchus. <a name="footnotetag476"
  href="#footnote476"><sup>[476]</sup></a>Bochart derives his name from
  Silan, <span lang="he" title="SHYLN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5D9;&#x5DC;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>, and supposes him to
  have been the same as Shiloh, the Messias. Sandford makes him to be
  Balaam, the false prophet. <a name="footnotetag477"
  href="#footnote477"><sup>[477]</sup></a>Huetius maintains that he was
  assuredly Moses. It is not uncommon to find even in the same writer great
  uncertainty: we have sometimes two, sometimes three, etymologies
  presented together of the same word: two out of the three must be
  groundless, and the third not a whit better: otherwise, the author would
  have given it the preference, and set the other two aside. An example to
  this purpose we have in the etymology of Ramesses, as it is explained in
  the <a name="footnotetag478"
  href="#footnote478"><sup>[478]</sup></a>Hebrew Onomasticum. Ramesses,
  tonitruum vel exprobratio tineæ; aut malum delens sive dissolvens; vel
  contractionem dissolvens, aut confractus a tineâ&mdash;civitas in
  extremis finibus Ægypti. A similar interpretation is given of Berodach, a
  king of Babylon. Berodach: creans contritionem, vel electio interitus,
  aut filius interitus, vel vaporis tui; sive frumentum; vel puritas nubis,
  vel vaporis tui. Rex Babyloniæ.</p>

  <p>It must be acknowledged of Bochart, that the system upon which he has
  proceeded is the most plausible of any; and he has shewn infinite
  ingenuity and learning. He every where tries to support his etymologies
  by some history of the place concerning which he treats. But the
  misfortune is, that the names of places which seem to be original, and of
  high antiquity, are too often deduced by him from circumstances of later
  date; from events in after ages. The histories to which he appeals were
  probably not known when the country, or island, received its name. He
  likewise allows himself a great latitude in forming his derivations: for,
  to make his terms accord, he has recourse, not only to the Phenician
  language, which he supposes to have been a dialect of the Hebrew; but to
  the Arabian, Chaldaic, and Syriac, according as his occasions require. It
  happens to him often to make use of a verb for a radix, which has many
  variations and different significations: but, at this rate, we may form a
  similitude between terms the most dissimilar. For, take a word in any
  language, which admits of many inflexions and variations, and, after we
  have made it undergo all its evolutions, it will be hard if it does not
  in some degree approximate. But, to say the truth, he many times does not
  seem to arrive even at this: for, after he has analysed the premises with
  great labour, we often find the supposed resemblance too vague and remote
  to be admitted; and the whole is effected with a great strain and force
  upon history before he brings matters to a seeming coincidence. The
  Cyclops are by the best writers placed in Sicily, near Mount <a
  name="footnotetag479" href="#footnote479"><sup>[479]</sup></a>Ætna, in
  the country of the Leontini, called of old Xuthia; but Bochart removes
  them to the south-west point of the island. This he supposes to have been
  called Lelub, <span title="Lilubaion" class="grk"
  >&#x39B;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>,
  from being opposite to Libya; and, as the promontory was so named, it is,
  he thinks, probable that the sea below was styled Chec Lelub, or Sinus
  Lebub: and, as the Cyclops lived hereabouts, they were from hence
  denominated Chec-lelub, and Chec-lub, out of which the Greeks formed <a
  name="footnotetag480" href="#footnote480"><sup>[480]</sup></a><span
  title="Kuklôpes" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3C9;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>. He
  derives the Siculi first from <a name="footnotetag481"
  href="#footnote481"><sup>[481]</sup></a>seclul, perfection; and
  afterwards from <span lang="he" title="ASHKWL" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5E9;&#x5DB;&#x5D5;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>, Escol,
  pronounced, according to the Syriac, Sigol, a bunch of grapes. He deduces
  the Sicani from <span lang="he" title="SHKN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5DB;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>, Sacan<a
  name="footnotetag482" href="#footnote482"><sup>[482]</sup></a>, near,
  because they were near their next neighbours; in other words, on account
  of their being next to the P&#339;ni. Sicani, qui Siculorum P&#339;nis
  proximi. But, according to the best accounts, the Sicani were the most
  antient people of any in these parts. They settled in Sicily before the
  foundation of Carthage; and could not have been named from any such
  vicinity. In short, Bochart, in most of his derivations, refers to
  circumstances too general; which might be adapted to one place as well as
  to another. He looks upon the names of places, and of people, rather as
  by-names, and chance appellations, than original marks of distinction;
  and supposes them to have been founded upon some subsequent history.
  Whereas they were, most of them, original terms of high antiquity,
  imported and assumed by the people themselves, and not imposed by
  others.</p>

  <p>How very casual and indeterminate the references were by which this
  learned man was induced to form his etymologies, let the reader judge
  from the samples below. These were taken, for the most part, from his
  accounts of the Grecian islands; not industriously picked out; but as
  they casually presented themselves upon turning over the book. He derives

  and the reason he gives, is, because it was naturally secure. Whatever
  may have been the purport of the term, Mizraim was a very antient and
  original name, and could have no reference to these after-considerations.
  The author of the Onomasticum, therefore, differs from him, and has tried
  to mend the matter. He allows that the people, and country, were
  denominated from Mazor, but in a different acceptation: from Mazor, which
  signified, the double pressure of a mother on each side<a

  Michaelis observes&mdash;<a name="footnotetag496"
  href="#footnote496"><sup>[496]</sup></a>quo etymo vix aliud veri

  <p>In the theology of the Greeks are many antient terms, which learned
  men have tried to analyse, and define. But they seem to have failed here
  too by proceeding upon those fallacious principles, of which I have above
  complained. In short, they seldom go deep enough in their inquiries; nor
  consider the true character of the personage, which they would decypher.
  It is said of the God Vulcan, that he was the same as Tubalcain,
  mentioned Genesis. c. 4. v. 22: and it is a notion followed by many
  writers: and among others by Gale. <a name="footnotetag497"
  href="#footnote497"><sup>[497]</sup></a><i>First as to the name</i> (says
  this learned man) <i>Vossius</i>, de Idolat. l. 1. c. 36, <i>shews us,
  that Vulcanus is the same as Tubalcainus, only by a wonted, and easy
  mutation of B into V, and casting away a syllable</i>. And he afterwards
  affects to prove from Diodorus Siculus, that the art and office of Vulcan
  exactly corresponded to the character of Tubalcain, <a
  name="footnotetag498" href="#footnote498"><sup>[498]</sup></a><i>who was
  an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron</i>. Upon the same
  principles Philo Biblius speaking of Chrusor, a person of great
  antiquity, who first built a ship, and navigated the seas; who also first
  taught husbandry, and hunting, supposes him to have been Vulcan; because
  it is farther said of him, <a name="footnotetag499"
  href="#footnote499"><sup>[499]</sup></a>that he first manufactured iron.
  From this partial resemblance to Vulcan or Hephastus, Bochart is induced
  to derive his name from <span lang="he" title="KRSH AWR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5E8;&#x5E9; &#x5D0;&#x5D5;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>,
  Chores Ur, an artificer in <a name="footnotetag500"
  href="#footnote500"><sup>[500]</sup></a>fire. These learned men do not
  consider, that though the name, to which they refer, be antient, and
  oriental, yet the character, and attributes, are comparatively modern,
  having been introduced from another quarter. Vulcan the blacksmith, who
  was the master of the Cyclops, and forged iron in Mount Ætna, was a
  character familiar to the Greeks, and Romans. But this Deity among the
  Egyptians, and Babylonians, had nothing similar to this description. They
  esteemed Vulcan as the chief of the Gods the same as the Sun: and his
  name is a sacred title, compounded of Baal-Cahen, Belus sanctus, vel
  Princeps; equivalent to Orus, or Osiris. If the name were of a different
  original, yet it would be idle to seek for an etymology founded on later
  conceptions, and deduced from properties not originally inherent in the
  personage. According to <a name="footnotetag501"
  href="#footnote501"><sup>[501]</sup></a>Hermapion he was looked upon as
  the source of all divinity, and in consequence of it the inscription upon
  the portal of the temple at Heliopolis was <span title="Hêphaistôi tôi Theôn Patri" class="grk"
  >&#x1F29;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x1FF3; &#x3C4;&#x1FF3;
  &#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD; &#x3A0;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;</span>.
  <i>To Vulcan the Father of the Gods</i>. In short, they who first
  appropriated the name of Vulcan to their Deity, had no notion of his
  being an artificer in brass or iron: or an artificer in any degree. Hence
  we must be cautious in forming ideas of the antient theology of nations
  from the current notions of the Greeks, and Romans; and more especially
  from the descriptions of their poets. Polytheism, originally vile, and
  unwarrantable, was rendered ten times more base by coming through their
  hands. To instance in one particular: among all the dæmon herd what one
  is there of a form, and character, so odious, and contemptible as
  Priapus? an obscure ill-formed Deity, who was ridiculed and dishonoured
  by his very votaries. His hideous figure was made use of only as a
  bugbear to frighten children; and to drive the birds from fruit trees;
  with whose filth he was generally besmeared. Yet this contemptible God,
  this scarecrow in a garden, was held in high repute at Lampsacus, and
  esteemed the same as <a name="footnotetag502"
  href="#footnote502"><sup>[502]</sup></a>Dionusus. He was likewise by the
  Egyptians reverenced as the principal God; no other than the Chaldaic <a
  name="footnotetag503" href="#footnote503"><sup>[503]</sup></a>Aur, the
  same as Orus and Apis: whose rites were particularly solemn. It was from
  hence that he had his name: for Priapus of Greece is only a compound of
  Peor-Apis among the Egyptians. He was sometimes styled Peor singly; also
  Baal Peor; the same with whose rites the Israelites are so often <a
  name="footnotetag504" href="#footnote504"><sup>[504]</sup></a>upbraided.
  His temples likewise are mentioned, which are styled Beth Peor. In short,
  this wretched divinity of the Romans was looked upon by others as the
  soul of the world: the first principle, which brought all things into
  light, and being. <a name="footnotetag505"

  agree well with Dionusus. Phurnutus supposes Priapus to have been the
  same as Pan, the shepherd God: who was equally degraded, and
  misrepresented on one hand, and as highly reverenced on the other. <a

  <p>It may be proper to take some previous notice of those writers, to
  whose assistance we must particularly have recourse; and whose evidence
  may be most depended upon, in disquisitions of this nature. All knowledge
  of Gentile antiquity must be derived to us through the hands of the
  Grecians: and there is not of them a single writer, to whom we may not be
  indebted for some advantage. The Helladians, however, from whom we might
  expect most light, are to be admitted with the greatest caution. They
  were a bigotted people, highly prejudiced in their own favour; and so
  devoted to idle tradition, that no arguments could wean them from their
  folly. Hence the surest resources are from Greeks of other countries.
  Among the Poets, Lycophron, Callimachus, and Apollonius Rhodius are
  principally to be esteemed. The last of these was a native of Egypt; and
  the other two lived there, and have continual allusions to the
  antiquities of that country. Homer likewise abounds with a deal of
  mysterious lore, borrowed from the antient Amonian theology; with which
  his commentators have been often embarrassed. To these may be added such
  Greek writers of later date, who were either not born in Hellas, or were
  not so deeply tinctured with the vanity of that country. Much light may
  be also obtained from those learned men, by whom the Scholia were
  written, which are annexed to the works of the Poets above-mentioned.
  Nonnus too, who wrote the Dionysiaca, is not to be neglected. He was a
  native of Panopolis in Egypt, <a name="footnotetag509"
  href="#footnote509"><sup>[509]</sup></a><span title="Ek tês Panos tês Aiguptou gegenêmenos" class="grk"

  and had opportunity of collecting many antient traditions, and fragments
  of mysterious history, which never were known in Greece. To these may be
  added Porphyry, Proclus, and Jamblichus, who professedly treat of
  Egyptian learning. The Isis and Osiris of Plutarch may be admitted with
  proper circumspection. It may be said, that the whole is still an enigma:
  and I must confess that it is: but we receive it more copiously
  exemplified; and more clearly defined; and it must necessarily be more
  genuine, by being nearer the fountain head: so that by comparing, and
  adjusting the various parts, we are more likely to arrive at a solution
  of the hidden purport. But the great resource of all is to be found among
  the later antiquaries and historians. Many of these are writers of high
  rank; particularly Diodorus, Strabo, and Pausanias, on the Gentile part:
  and of the fathers, Theophilus, Tatianus Athenagoras, Clemens, Origenes,
  Eusebius, Theodoretus, Syncellus; and the compiler of the Fasti Siculi,
  otherwise called Chronicon Paschale. Most of these were either of Egypt
  or Asia. They had a real taste for antiquity; and lived at a time when
  some insight could be obtained: for till the Roman Empire was fully
  established, and every province in a state of tranquillity, little light
  could be procured from those countries, whence the mythology of Greece
  was derived. The native Helladians were very limited in their knowledge.
  They had taken in the gross whatever was handed down by tradition; and
  assumed to themselves every history, which was imported. They moreover
  held every nation but their own as barbarous; so that their insuperable
  vanity rendered it impossible for them to make any great advances in
  historical knowledge. But the writers whom I just now mentioned, either
  had not these prejudices; or lived at a time when they were greatly
  subsided. They condescended to quote innumerable authors, and some of
  great antiquity; to whom the pride of Greece would never have appealed. I
  had once much talk upon this subject with a learned friend, since lost to
  the world, who could ill brook that Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon,
  should be discarded for Clemens, Origen, or Eusebius; and that Lysias and
  Demosthenes should give way to Libanius and Aristides. The name of
  Tzetzes, or Eustathius, he could not bear. To all which I repeatedly made
  answer; that it was by no means my intention to set aside any of the
  writers, he mentioned: whose merits, as far as they extended, I held in
  great veneration. On the contrary, I should have recourse to their
  assistance, as far as it would carry me: But I must at the same time take
  upon me to weigh those merits; and see wherein they consisted; and to
  what degree they were to be trusted. The Helladians were much to be
  admired for the smoothness of their periods, and a happy collocation of
  their terms. They shewed a great propriety of diction; and a beautiful
  arrangement of their ideas: and the whole was attended with a rhythm, and
  harmony, no where else to be found. But they were at the same time under
  violent prejudices: and the subject matter of which they treated, was in
  general so brief, and limited, that very little could be obtained from it
  towards the history of other countries, or a knowledge of antient times.
  Even in respect to their own affairs, whatever light had been derived to
  them, was so perverted, and came through so dim a medium, that it is
  difficult to make use of it to any determinate and salutary purpose. Yet
  the beauty of their composition has been attended with wonderful <a
  name="footnotetag510" href="#footnote510"><sup>[510]</sup></a>influence.
  Many have been so far captivated by this magic, as to give an implicit
  credence to all that has been transmitted; and to sacrifice their
  judgment to the pleasures of the fancy.</p>

  <p>It may be said, that the writers, to whom I chiefly appeal, are, in
  great measure, dry and artless, without any grace and ornament to
  recommend them. They were likewise posterior to the Helladians;
  consequently farther removed from the times of which they treat. To the
  first objection I answer, that the most dry and artless historians are,
  in general, the most authentic. They who colour and embellish, have the
  least regard for the truth. In respect to priority, it is a specious
  claim; but attended with no validity. When a gradual darkness has been
  overspreading the world, it requires as much time to emerge from the
  cloud, as there passed when we were sinking into it: so that they who
  come later may enjoy a greater portion of light, than those who preceded
  them by ages. Besides, it is to be considered, that the writers, to whom
  I chiefly appeal, lived in parts of the world which gave them great
  advantages. The whole theology of Greece was derived from the east. We
  cannot therefore but in reason suppose, that Clemens of Alexandria,
  Eusebius of Cæsarea, Tatianus of Assyria, Lucianus of Samosata, Cyril of
  Jerusalem, Porphyry of Syria, Proclus of Lycia, Philo of Biblus, Strabo
  of Amasa, Pausanias of Cappadocia, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, must know more
  upon this subject than any native Helladian. The like may be said of
  Diodorus, Josephus, Cedrenus, Syncellus, Zonaras, Eustathius: and
  numberless more. These had the archives of antient <a
  name="footnotetag511" href="#footnote511"><sup>[511]</sup></a>temples, to
  which they could apply: and had traditions more genuine than ever reached
  Greece. And though they were posterior themselves, they appeal to authors
  far prior to any Helladians: and their works are crowded with extracts
  from the most curious and the most antient <a name="footnotetag512"
  href="#footnote512"><sup>[512]</sup></a>histories. Such were the writings
  of Sanchoniathon, Berosus, Nicholaus Damascenus, Mocus, Mnaseas,
  Hieronymus Ægyptius, Apion, Manethon: from whom Abydenus, Apollodorus,
  Asclepiades, Artapanus, Philastrius, borrowed largely. We are beholden to
  Clemens<a name="footnotetag513" href="#footnote513"><sup>[513]</sup></a>,
  and Eusebius, for many evidences from writers, long since lost; even
  Eustathius and Tzetzes have resources, which are now no more.</p>

  <p>It must be after all confessed, that those, who preceded, had many
  opportunities of information, had they been willing to have been
  informed. It is said, both of Pythagoras and Solon, that they resided for
  some time in Egypt: where the former was instructed by a Son-chen, or
  priest of the Sun. But I could never hear of any great good that was the
  consequence of his travels. Thus much is certain; that whatever knowledge
  he may have picked up in other parts, he got nothing from the Grecians.
  They, who pretended most to wisdom, were the most destitute of the
  blessing. <a name="footnotetag514"

  And as their theology was before very obscure, he drew over it a
  mysterious veil to make it tenfold darker. The chief of the intelligence
  transmitted by Solon from Egypt contained a satire upon his own country.
  He was told by an antient <a name="footnotetag515"
  href="#footnote515"><sup>[515]</sup></a>priest, that the Grecians were
  children in science: that they were utterly ignorant of the mythology of
  other nations; and did not understand their own. Eudoxus likewise and
  Plato were in Egypt; and are said to have resided there some time: yet
  very few things of moment have been transmitted by them. Plato had great
  opportunities of rectifying the history and mythology of Greece: but
  after all his advantages he is accused of trifling shamefully, and
  addicting himself to fable. <a name="footnotetag516"

  the rites of the Helladians, as well as their Gods and Heroes, were
  imported from the <a name="footnotetag517"
  href="#footnote517"><sup>[517]</sup></a>east: and chiefly from <a
  name="footnotetag518" href="#footnote518"><sup>[518]</sup></a>Egypt,
  though they were unwilling to allow it. Length of time had greatly
  impaired their true history; and their prejudices would not suffer them
  to retrieve it. I should therefore think it by no means improper to
  premise a short account of this wonderful people, in order to shew whence
  this obscurity arose; which at last prevailed so far, that they, in great
  measure, lost sight of their origin, and were involved in mystery and
  fable.</p>

  <p>The first inhabitants of the country, called afterwards Hellas, were
  the sons of Javan; who seem to have degenerated very early, and to have
  become truly barbarous. Hence the best historians of Greece confess, that
  their ancestors were not the first inhabitants; but that it was before
  their arrival in the possession of a people, whom they style <a
  name="footnotetag519" href="#footnote519"><sup>[519]</sup></a><span
  title="Barbaroi" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, or
  Barbarians. The Helladians were colonies of another family: and
  introduced themselves somewhat later. They were of the race which I term
  Amonian; and came from Egypt and Syria: but originally from Babylonia.
  They came under various titles, all taken from the religion, which they
  professed. Of these titles I shall have occasion to treat at large; and
  of the imaginary leaders, by whom they were supposed to have been
  conducted.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Amonians were settled, and incorporated with the
  natives, a long interval of darkness ensued. The very union produced a
  new language: at least the antient Amonian became by degrees so modified,
  and changed, that the terms of science, and worship, were no longer
  understood. Hence the titles of their Gods were misapplied: and the whole
  of their theology grew more and more corrupted; so that very few traces
  of the original were to be discovered. In short, almost every term was
  misconstrued, and abused. This<a name="footnotetag520"
  href="#footnote520"><sup>[520]</sup></a> æra of darkness was of long
  duration: at last the Asiatic Greeks began to bestir themselves. They had
  a greater correspondence than the Helladians: and they were led to exert
  their talents from examples in Syria, Egypt, and other countries. The
  specimens, which they exhibited of their genius were amazing: and have
  been justly esteemed a standard for elegance and nature. The Athenians
  were greatly affected with these examples. They awoke, as it were, out of
  a long and deep sleep; and, as if they had been in the training of
  science for ages, their first efforts bordered upon perfection. In the
  space of a century, out of one little confined district, were produced a
  group of worthies, who at all times have been the wonder of the world: so
  that we may apply to the nation in general what was spoken of the school
  of a philosopher: cujus ex ludo, tanquam ex Equo Trojano, meri Principes
  exierunt. But this happy display of parts did not remedy the evil of
  which I have complained. They did not retrieve any lost annals, nor were
  any efforts made to dispel the cloud in which they were involved. There
  had been, as I have represented, a long interval; during which there must
  have happened great occurrences: but few of them had been transmitted to
  posterity; and those handed down by tradition, and mixed with
  inconsistency and fable. It is said that letters were brought into Greece
  very early, by <a name="footnotetag521"
  href="#footnote521"><sup>[521]</sup></a>Cadmus. Let us for a while grant
  it; and inquire what was the progress. They had the use of them so far as
  to put an inscription on the pediment of a temple, or upon a pillar; or
  to scrawl a man's name upon a tile or an oyster-shell, when they wanted
  to banish or poison him. Such scanty knowledge, and so base materials, go
  but a little way towards science. What history was there of Corinth, or
  of Sparta? What annals were there of Argos, or Messena; of Elis, or the
  cities of Achaia? None: not even of <a name="footnotetag522"
  href="#footnote522"><sup>[522]</sup></a>Athens. There are not the least
  grounds to surmise that any single record existed. The names of the
  Olympic victors from Cor&#339;bus, and of the priestesses of Argos, were
  the principal memorials to which they pretended: but how little knowledge
  could be obtained from hence! The laws of Draco, in the thirty-ninth
  Olympiad, were certainly the most antient writing to which we can
  securely appeal. When the Grecians began afterwards to bestir themselves,
  and to look back upon what had passed, they collected whatever accounts
  could be <a name="footnotetag523"
  href="#footnote523"><sup>[523]</sup></a>obtained. They tried also to
  separate and arrange them, to the best of their abilities, and to make
  the various parts of their history correspond. They had still some good
  materials to proceed upon, had they thoroughly understood them; but
  herein was a great failure. Among the various traditions handed down,
  they did not consider which really related to their country, and which
  had been introduced from other<a name="footnotetag524"
  href="#footnote524"><sup>[524]</sup></a> parts. Indeed they did not chuse
  to distinguish, but adopted all for their own; taking the merit of every
  antient transaction to themselves. No people had a greater love for
  science, nor displayed a more refined taste in composition. Their study
  was ever to please, and to raise admiration. Hence they always aimed at
  the marvellous, which they dressed up in a most winning manner: at the
  same time they betrayed a seeming veneration for antiquity. But their
  judgment was perverted, and this veneration attended with little regard
  for the truth. <a name="footnotetag525"
  href="#footnote525"><sup>[525]</sup></a>They had a high opinion of
  themselves, and of their country in general: and, being persuaded that
  they sprang from the ground on which they stood, and that the Arcadians
  were older than the moon, they rested satisfied with this, and looked no
  farther. In short, they had no love for any thing genuine, no desire to
  be instructed. Their history could not be reformed but by an
  acknowledgment which their pride would not suffer them to make. They
  therefore devoted themselves to an idle mythology: and there was nothing
  so contradictory and absurd but was greedily admitted, if sanctified by
  tradition. Even when the truth glared in their very faces, they turned
  from the light, and would not be undeceived. Those who, like Euemerus and
  Ephorus, had the courage to dissent from their legends, were deemed
  atheists and apostates, and treated accordingly. Plutarch more than once
  insists that it is expedient to veil the truth, and to dress it up in <a
  name="footnotetag526" href="#footnote526"><sup>[526]</sup></a>allegory.
  They went so far as to deem inquiry a <a name="footnotetag527"
  href="#footnote527"><sup>[527]</sup></a>crime, and thus precluded the
  only means by which the truth could be obtained.</p>

  <p>Nor did these prejudices appear only in respect to their own rites and
  theology, and the history of their own nation: the accounts which they
  gave of other countries were always tinctured with this predominant
  vanity. An idle zeal made them attribute to their forefathers the merit
  of many great performances to which they were utterly strangers: and
  supposed them to have founded cities in various parts of the world where
  the name of Greece could not have been known; cities which were in being
  before Greece was a state. Wherever they got footing, or even a transient
  acquaintance, they in their descriptions accommodated every thing to
  their own preconceptions; and expressed all terms according to their own
  mode of writing and pronunciation, that appearances might be in their
  favour. To this were added a thousand silly stories to support their
  pretended claim. They would persuade us that Jason of Greece founded the
  empire of the Medes; as Perseus, of the same country, did that of the
  Persians. Armenus, a companion of Jason, was the reputed father of the
  Armenians. They gave out that Tarsus, one of the most antient cities in
  the world, was built by people from <a name="footnotetag528"
  href="#footnote528"><sup>[528]</sup></a>Argos; and that Pelusium of Egypt
  had a name of Grecian <a name="footnotetag529"
  href="#footnote529"><sup>[529]</sup></a>original. They, too, built Sais,
  in the same <a name="footnotetag530"
  href="#footnote530"><sup>[530]</sup></a>country: and the city of the Sun,
  styled Heliopolis, owed its origin to an <a name="footnotetag531"
  href="#footnote531"><sup>[531]</sup></a>Athenian. They were so weak as to
  think that the city Canobus had its name from a pilot of Menelaus, and
  that even Memphis was built by Epaphos of <a name="footnotetag532"
  href="#footnote532"><sup>[532]</sup></a>Argos. There surely was never any
  nation so incurious and indifferent about truth. Hence have arisen those
  contradictions and inconsistences with which their history is <a
  name="footnotetag533"
  href="#footnote533"><sup>[533]</sup></a>embarrassed.</p>

  <p>It may appear ungracious, and I am sure it is far from a pleasing task
  to point out blemishes in a people of so refined a turn as the Grecians,
  whose ingenuity and elegance have been admired for ages. Nor would I
  engage in a display of this kind, were it not necessary to shew their
  prejudices and mistakes, in order to remedy their failures. On our part
  we have been too much accustomed to take in the gross with little or no
  examination, whatever they have been pleased to transmit: and there is no
  method of discovering the truth but by shewing wherein they failed, and
  pointing out the mode of error, the line of deviation. By unravelling the
  clue, we may be at last led to see things in their original state, and to
  reduce their mythology to order. That my censures are not groundless, nor
  carried to an undue degree of severity, may be proved from the like
  accusations from some of their best writers; who accuse them both of
  ignorance and forgery. <a name="footnotetag534"
  href="#footnote534"><sup>[534]</sup></a>Hecatæus, of Miletus,
  acknowledges, <i>that the traditions of the Greeks were as ridiculous as
  they were numerous</i>: <a name="footnotetag535"
  href="#footnote535"><sup>[535]</sup></a>and Philo confesses <i>that he
  could obtain little intelligence from that quarter: that the Grecians had
  brought a mist upon learning, so that it was impossible to discover the
  truth: he therefore applied to people of other countries for information,
  from whom only it could be obtained</i>. Plato<a name="footnotetag536"
  href="#footnote536"><sup>[536]</sup></a> owned <i>that the most genuine
  helps to philosophy were borrowed from those who by the Greeks were
  styled barbarous</i>: and <a name="footnotetag537"
  href="#footnote537"><sup>[537]</sup></a>Jamblichus gives the true reason
  for the preference. <i>The Helladians</i>, says this writer, <i>are ever
  wavering and unsettled in their principles, and are carried about by the
  least impulse. They want steadiness; and if they obtain any salutary
  knowledge, they cannot retain it; nay, they quit it with a kind of
  eagerness; and, whatever they do admit, they new mould and fashion,
  according to some novel and uncertain mode of reasoning. But people of
  other countries are more determinate in their principles, and abide more
  uniformly by the very terms which they have traditionally received.</i>
  They are represented in the same light by Theophilus: <a
  name="footnotetag538" href="#footnote538"><sup>[538]</sup></a>he says,
  <i>that they wrote merely for empty praise, and were so blinded with
  vanity, that they neither discovered the truth theirselves, nor
  encouraged others to pursue it</i>. Hence Tatianus says, with great
  truth, <a name="footnotetag539"
  href="#footnote539"><sup>[539]</sup></a><i>that the writers of other
  countries were strangers to that vanity with which the Grecians were
  infected: that they were more simple and uniform, and did not encourage
  themselves in an affected variety of notions</i>.</p>

  <p>In respect to foreign history, and geographical knowledge, the Greeks,
  in general, were very ignorant: and the writers, who, in the time of the
  Roman Empire, began to make more accurate inquiries, met with insuperable
  difficulties from the mistakes of those who had preceded. I know no
  censure more severe and just than that which Strabo has passed upon the
  historians and geographers of Greece, and of its writers in general. In
  speaking of the Asiatic nations, he assures us, that there never had been
  any account transmitted of them upon which we can depend. <a
  name="footnotetag540" href="#footnote540"><sup>[540]</sup></a><i>Some of
  these nations</i>, says this judicious writer, <i>the Grecians have
  called Sacæ, and others Massagetæ, without having the least light to
  determine them. And though they have pretended to give a history of
  Cyrus, and his particular wars with those who were called Massagetæ, yet
  nothing precise and satisfactory could ever be obtained; not even in
  respect to the war. There is the same uncertainty in respect to the
  antient history of the Persians, as well as to that of the Medes and
  Syrians. We can meet with little that can be deemed authentic, on account
  of the weakness of those who wrote, and their uniform love of fable. For,
  finding that writers, who professedly dealt in fiction without any
  pretensions to the truth, were regarded, they thought that they should
  make their writings equally acceptable, if in the system of their history
  they were to introduce circumstances, which they had neither seen nor
  heard, nor received upon the authority of another person; proceeding
  merely upon this principle, that they should be most likely to please
  people's fancy by having recourse to what was marvellous and new. On this
  account we may more safely trust to Hesiod and Homer, when they present
  us with a list of Demigods and Heroes, and even to the tragic poets, than
  to Ctesias, Herodotus, and Hellanicus, and writers of that class. Even
  the generality of historians, who wrote about Alexander, are not safely
  to be trusted: for they speak with great confidence, relying upon the
  glory of the monarch, whom they celebrate; and to the remoteness of the
  countries, in which he was engaged; even at the extremities of Asia; at a
  great distance from us and our concerns. This renders them very secure.
  For what is referred to a distance is difficult to be confuted</i>. In
  another place, speaking of India, he says, that it was very difficult to
  arrive at the truth: <i>for the <a name="footnotetag541"
  href="#footnote541"><sup>[541]</sup></a>writers, who must necessarily be
  appealed to, were in continual opposition, and contradicted one another.
  And how</i>, says Strabo, <i>could it be otherwise? for if they erred so
  shamefully when they had ocular proof, how could they speak with
  certainty, where they were led by hearsay?</i> In another place<a
  name="footnotetag542" href="#footnote542"><sup>[542]</sup></a> he excuses
  the mistakes of the antient poets, saying, that we must not wonder if
  they sometimes deviated from the truth, when people in ages more
  enlightened were so ignorant, and so devoted to every thing marvellous
  and incredible. He had above given the poets even the preference to other
  writers: but herein his zeal transported him too far. The first writers
  were the poets; and the mischief began from them. They first infected
  tradition; and mixed it with allegory and fable. Of this Athenagoras
  accuses them very justly; and says, <a name="footnotetag543"
  href="#footnote543"><sup>[543]</sup></a><i>that the greatest abuses of
  true knowledge came from them. I insist</i>, says this learned father,
  <i>that we owe to Orpheus, Homer, and Hesiod, the fictitious names and
  genealogies of the Pagan Dæmons, whom they are pleased to style Gods: and
  I can produce Herodotus for a witness to what I assert. He informs us,
  that Homer and Hesiod were about four hundred years prior to himself; and
  not more. These, says he, were the persons who first framed the theogony
  of the Greeks; and gave appellations to their Deities; and distinguished
  them according to their several ranks and departments. They at the same
  time described them under different appearances: for till their time
  there was not in Greece any representation of the Gods, either in
  sculpture or painting; not any specimen of the statuary's art exhibited:
  no such substitutes were in those times thought of.</i></p>

  <p>The antient history and mythology of Greece was partly transmitted by
  the common traditions of the natives: and partly preserved in those
  original Doric hymns, which were universally sung in their Prutaneia and
  temples. These were in the antient Amonian language; and said to have
  been introduced by <a name="footnotetag544"
  href="#footnote544"><sup>[544]</sup></a>Pagasus, Agyieus, and Olen. This
  last some represent as a Lycian, others as an Hyperborean: and by many he
  was esteemed an Egyptian. They were chanted by the Purcones, or priests
  of the Sun: and by the female, Hierophants: of whom the chief upon record
  were <a name="footnotetag545"
  href="#footnote545"><sup>[545]</sup></a>Phaënnis, <a
  name="footnotetag546" href="#footnote546"><sup>[546]</sup></a>Phæmonoë,
  and Bæo. The last of these mentions Olen, as the inventor of verse, and
  the most antient priest of Ph&#339;bus.</p>

  <p>These hymns grew, by length of time, obsolete; and scarce
  intelligible. They were, however, translated, or rather imitated, by
  Pamphos, Rhianus, Phemius, Homer, Bion Proconnesius, Onomacritus, and
  others. Many of the sacred terms could not be understood, nor
  interpreted; they were however <a name="footnotetag548"
  href="#footnote548"><sup>[548]</sup></a>retained with great reverence:
  and many which they did attempt to decipher, were misconstrued and
  misapplied. Upon this basis was the theology of Greece founded: from
  hence were the names of Gods taken: and various departments attributed to
  the several Deities. Every poet had something different in his theogony:
  and every variety, however inconsistent, was admitted by the Greeks
  without the least hesitation: <a name="footnotetag549"

  Grecians</i>, says Jamblichus, <i>are naturally led by novelty: The
  investigation of truth is too fatiguing for a Grecian</i>. From these
  antient hymns and misconstrued terms <a name="footnotetag550"
  href="#footnote550"><sup>[550]</sup></a>Pherecydes of Syrus planned his
  history of the Gods: which, there is reason to think, was the source of
  much error.</p>

  <p>Such were the principles which gave birth to the mythology of the
  Grecians; from whence their antient history was in great measure derived.
  As their traditions were obsolete, and filled with extraneous matter, it
  rendered it impossible for them to arrange properly the principal events
  of their country. They did not separate and distinguish; but often took
  to themselves the merit of transactions, which were of a prior date, and
  of another clime. These they adopted, and made their own. Hence, when
  they came to digest their history, it was all confused: and they were
  embarrassed with numberless contradictions, and absurdities, which it was
  impossible to <a name="footnotetag551"
  href="#footnote551"><sup>[551]</sup></a>remedy. For their vanity, as I
  have shewn, would not suffer them to rectify their mistakes by the
  authority of more antient and more learned nations. It is well observed
  by Tatianus <a name="footnotetag552"
  href="#footnote552"><sup>[552]</sup></a>Assyrius, <i>that where the
  history of times past has not been duly adjusted, it is impossible to
  arrive at the truth: and there has been no greater cause of error in
  writing, than the endeavouring to adopt what is groundless and
  inconsistent.</i> Sir Isaac Newton somewhere lays it down for a rule,
  never to admit for history what is antecedent to letters. For
  traditionary truths cannot be long preserved without some change in
  themselves, and some addition of foreign circumstances. This accretion
  will be in every age enlarged; till there will at last remain some few
  outlines only of the original occurrence. It has been maintained by many,
  that the Grecians had letters very early: but it will appear upon inquiry
  to have been a groundless notion. Those of the antients, who considered
  the matter more carefully, have made no scruple to set aside their <a
  name="footnotetag553"
  href="#footnote553"><sup>[553]</sup></a>pretensions. Josephus in
  particular takes notice of their early claim; but cannot allow it: <a
  name="footnotetag554"
  href="#footnote554"><sup>[554]</sup></a><i>They</i>, says this learned
  historian, <i>who would carry the introduction of letters among the
  Greeks the highest, very gravely tell us, that they were brought over by
  the Phenicians, and Cadmus. Yet, after all, they cannot produce a single
  specimen either from their sacred writings, or from their popular
  records, which savours of that antiquity</i>. Theophilus takes notice of
  these difficulties; and shews that all the obscurity, with which the
  history of Hellas is clouded, arose from this deficiency of letters. He
  complains, <i>that the <a name="footnotetag555"
  href="#footnote555"><sup>[555]</sup></a>Hellenes had lost sight of the
  truth; and could not recollect any genuine history. The reason of this is
  obvious: for they came late to the knowledge of letters in comparison of
  other nations. This they confess, by attributing the invention of them to
  people prior to themselves; either to the Chaldeans, or the Egyptians: or
  else to the Phenicians. Another cause of failure, which relates to their
  theology, and still greatly prevails, is owing to their not making a
  proper disquisition about the true object of worship: but amusing
  themselves with idle, and unprofitable speculations</i>.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding this deficiency, they pretended to give a list of
  Argive princes, of which twenty preceded the war of <a
  name="footnotetag556" href="#footnote556"><sup>[556]</sup></a>Troy. But
  what is more extraordinary, they boasted of a series of twenty-six Kings
  at Sicyon, comprehending a space of one thousand years, all which kings
  were before the time of <a name="footnotetag557"
  href="#footnote557"><sup>[557]</sup></a>Theseus and the Argonauts. Among
  those, who have given the list of the Argive kings, is <a
  name="footnotetag558" href="#footnote558"><sup>[558]</sup></a>Tatianus
  Assyrius, who advises every person of sense, when he meets with these
  high pretensions, to consider attentively, <i>that there was not a single
  voucher, not even a tradition of any record, to authenticate these
  histories: for even Cadmus was many ages after</i>. It is certain, that
  the Helladians had no tendency to learning, till they were awakened by
  the Asiatic Greeks: and it was even then some time before letters were in
  general use; or any histories, or even records attempted. For if letters
  had been current, and the materials for writing obvious, and in common
  use, how comes it that we have not one specimen older than the reign of
  Cyrus? And how is it possible, if the Grecians had any records, that they
  should be so ignorant about some of their most famous men? Of Homer how
  little is known! and of what is transmitted, how little, upon which we
  may depend! Seven places in Greece contend for his birth: while many
  doubt whether he was of Grecian original. It is said of Pythagoras, <a
  name="footnotetag559" href="#footnote559"><sup>[559]</sup></a>that
  according to Hippobotrus he was of Samos: but Aristoxenus, who wrote his
  life, as well as Aristarchus, and Theopompus, makes him a Tyrrhenian.
  According to Neanthes he was of Syria, or else a native of Tyre. In like
  manner Thales was said by Herodotus, Leander, and Duris, to have been a
  Phenician: but he was by others referred to Miletus in Ionia. It is
  reported of Pythagoras, that he visited Egypt in the time of Cambyses.
  From thence he betook himself to Croton in Italy: where he is supposed to
  have resided till the last year of the seventieth Olympiad: consequently
  he could not be above thirty or forty years prior to the birth of
  Æschylus and Pindar. What credit can we give to people for histories many
  ages backward; who were so ignorant in matters of importance, which
  happened in the days of their fathers? The like difficulties occur about
  Pherecydes Syrius; whom Suidas styles Babylonius: neither the time, when
  he lived, nor the place of his birth, have been ever satisfactorily

  space of which the true year consisted. <a name="footnotetag560"

  <p>Another reason may be given for the obscurity in the Grecian history,
  even when letters had been introduced among them. They had a childish
  antipathy to every foreign language: and were equally prejudiced in
  favour of their own. This has passed unnoticed; yet was attended with the
  most fatal consequences. They were misled by the too great delicacy of
  their ear; and could not bear any term which appeared to them barbarous
  and uncouth. On this account they either rejected foreign <a
  name="footnotetag561"
  href="#footnote561"><sup>[561]</sup></a>appellations; or so modelled and
  changed them, that they became, in sound and meaning, essentially
  different. And as they were attached to their own country, and its
  customs, they presumed that every thing was to be looked for among
  themselves. They did not consider, that the titles of their Gods, the
  names of cities, and their terms of worship, were imported: that their
  ancient hymns were grown obsolete: and that time had wrought a great
  change. They explained every thing by the language in use, without the
  least retrospect or allowance: and all names and titles from other
  countries were liable to the same rule. If the name were dissonant, and
  disagreeable to their ear, it was rejected as barbarous: but if it were
  at all similar in sound to any word in their language, they changed it to
  that word; though the name were of Syriac original; or introduced from
  Egypt, or Babylonia. The purport of the term was by these means changed:
  and the history, which depended upon it, either perverted or effaced.
  When the title Melech, which signified a King, was rendered <span
  title="Meilichos" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> and
  <span title="Meilichios" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  <i>sweet and gentle</i>, it referred to an idea quite different from the
  original. But this gave them no concern: they still blindly pursued their
  purpose. Some legend was immediately invented in consequence of this
  misprision, some story about bees and honey, and the mistake was rendered
  in some degree plausible. This is a circumstance of much consequence; and
  deserves our attention greatly. I shall have occasion to speak of it
  repeatedly; and to lay before the reader some entire treatises upon the
  subject. For this failure is of such a nature, as, when detected. and
  fairly explained, will lead us to the solution of many dark and
  enigmatical histories, with which the mythology of Greece abounds. The
  only author, who seems to have taken any notice of this unhappy turn in
  the Grecians, is Philo Biblius. <a name="footnotetag562"
  href="#footnote562"><sup>[562]</sup></a>He speaks of it as a circumstance
  of very bad consequence, and says, that it was the chief cause of error
  and obscurity: hence, when he met in Sanchoniathon with antient names, he
  did not indulge himself in whimsical solutions; but gave the true
  meaning, which was the result of some event or quality whence the name
  was imposed. This being a secret to the Greeks, they always took things
  in a wrong acceptation; being misled by a twofold sense of the terms
  which occurred to them: one was the genuine and original meaning, which
  was retained in the language whence they were taken: the other was a
  forced sense, which the Greeks unnaturally deduced from their own
  language, though there was no relation between them. The same term in
  different languages conveyed different and opposite ideas: and as they
  attended only to the meaning in their own tongue, they were constantly <a
  name="footnotetag563"
  href="#footnote563"><sup>[563]</sup></a>mistaken.</p>

  <p>It may appear strange to make use of the mistakes of any people for a
  foundation to build upon: yet through these failures my system will be in
  some degree supported: at least from a detection of these errors, I hope
  to obtain much light. For, as the Grecian writers have preserved a kind
  of uniformity in their mistakes, and there appears plainly a rule and
  method of deviation, it will be very possible, when this method is well
  known, to decypher what is covertly alluded to; and by these means arrive
  at the truth. If the openings in the wood or labyrinth are only as chance
  allotted, we may be for ever bewildered: but if they are made with
  design, and some method be discernible, this circumstance, if attended
  to, will serve for a clue, and lead us through the maze. If we once know
  that what the Greeks, in their mythology, styled a wolf, was the Sun;
  that by a dog was meant a prince, or Deity; that by bees was signified an
  order of priests; these terms, however misapplied, can no more mislead us
  in writing, than their resemblances in sculpture would a native of Egypt,
  if they were used for emblems on stone.</p>

  <p>Thus much I have been obliged to premise: as our knowledge must come
  through the hands of the <a name="footnotetag564"
  href="#footnote564"><sup>[564]</sup></a>Grecians. I am sensible, that
  many learned men have had recourse to other means for information: but I
  have never seen any specimens which have afforded much light. Those, to
  which I have been witness, have rather dazzled than illustrated; and
  bewildered instead of conducting to the truth. Among the Greeks is
  contained a great treasure of knowledge. It is a rich mine; which as yet
  has not been worked far beneath the surface. The ore lies deep, and
  cannot be obtained without much industry and labour. The Helladians had
  the best opportunities to have afforded us information about the
  antiquities of their country: of their negligence, and of their mistakes
  I have spoken; yet with a proper clue they may still be read to great
  advantage. To say the truth, there is scarce an author of them all, from
  whom some good may not be derived.</p>

  <p>What has been wanting in the natives of Greece, has been greatly
  supplied by writers of that nation from other countries, who lived in
  after-times. Of these the principal have been mentioned; and many others
  might be added, who were men of integrity and learning. They were fond of
  knowledge, and obtained a deep insight into antiquity: and, what is of
  the greatest consequence, they were attached to the truth. They may
  sometimes have been mistaken in their judgment: they may also have been
  deceived: but still truth was the scope at which they aimed. They have
  accordingly transmitted to us many valuable remains, which, but for them,
  had been buried in oblivion. There are likewise many pagan authors, to
  whom we are greatly indebted; but especially to Strabo and Pausanias; who
  in their different departments have afforded wonderful light. Nor must we
  omit Josephus of Judea; whose treatise against Apion must be esteemed of
  inestimable value: indeed, all his writings are of consequence, if read
  with a proper allowance.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned, that it is my purpose to give a history of the first
  ages; and to shew the origin of many nations, whose descent has been
  mistaken; or else totally unknown. I shall speak particularly of one
  great family, which diffused itself over many parts of the earth; from
  whom the rites and mysteries, and almost the whole science of the Gentile
  world, were borrowed. But as I venture in an unbeaten track, and in a
  waste, which has been little frequented; I shall first take upon me to
  treat of things near at hand, before I advance to remoter discoveries. I
  shall therefore speak of those rites and customs, and of the nations,
  where they prevailed; as I shall by these means be led insensibly to the
  discovery of the people, from whom they were derived. By a similarity of
  customs, as well as by the same religious terms, observable in different
  countries, it will be easy to shew a relation, which subsisted between
  such people, however widely dispersed. They will be found to have been
  colonies of the same family; and to have come ultimately from the same
  place. As my course will be in great measure an uphill labour, I shall
  proceed in the manner which I have mentioned; continually enlarging my
  prospect, till I arrive at the point I aim at.</p>

  <p>It may be proper to mention to the reader that the following treatises
  were not written in the order in which they now stand; but just as the
  subject-matter presented itself before me. As many, which were first
  composed, will occur last, I have been forced to anticipate some of the
  arguments, as well as quotations, which they contained, according as I
  found it expedient. Hence there will be some few instances of repetition,
  which however I hope will not give any great disgust: as what is
  repeated, was so interwoven in the argument, that I could not well
  disengage it from the text, where it occurs a second time.</p>

  <p>There will also be found some instances, where I differ from myself,
  and go contrary to positions in a former treatise. These are very few,
  and of no great moment; being such as would probably escape the reader's
  notice. But I think it more ingenuous, and indeed my strict duty, to own
  my mistakes, and point them out, rather than to pass them over in
  silence, or idly to defend them.</p>

  <p>We must never deduce the etymology of an Egyptian or oriental term
  from the Greek language. Eustathius well observes, <span title="Ei barbaron to onoma ou chrê zêtein Hellênikên etumologian autou." class="grk"
  >&#x395;&#x3B9; &#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;

  &#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;.</span></p>

  <p>We should recur to the Doric manner of expression, as being nearest to
  the original.</p>

  <p>The Greeks adopted all foreign history: and supposed it to have been
  of their own country.</p>

  <p>They mistook temples for Deities, and places for persons.</p>

  <p>They changed every foreign term to something similar in their own
  language; to something similar in sound, however remote in meaning; being
  led solely by the ear.</p>

  <p>They constantly mistook titles for names; and from these titles
  multiplied their Deities and Heroes.</p>

  <p>All terms of relation between the Deities to be disregarded.</p>

  <p>As the Grecians were mistaken, it is worth our while to observe the
  mode of error and uniformity of mistake. By attending to this, we may
  bring things back to their primitive state, and descry in antient terms
  the original meaning.</p>

  <p>We must have regard to the oblique cases, especially in nouns
  imparasyllabic, when we have an antient term transmitted to us either
  from the Greeks or Romans. The nominative, in both languages, is often
  abridged; so that, from the genitive of the word, or from the possessive,
  the original term is to be deduced. This will be found to obtain even in
  common names. From veteris we have veter for the true term; from
  sanguinis we have sanguen: and that this is right we may prove from
  Ennius, who says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag565" href="#footnote565"><sup>[565]</sup></a>O! pater, O! genitor, O! sanguen diis oriundum.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag566" href="#footnote566"><sup>[566]</sup></a>Cum veter occubuit Priamus sub marte Pelasgo.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So mentis, and not mens, was the true nominative to mentis, menti,
  mentem; as we may learn from the same author:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag567" href="#footnote567"><sup>[567]</sup></a>Istic est de sole sumptus ignis, isque mentis est.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In like manner Plebes was the nominative to Plebi and Plebem.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Deficit alma Ceres, nec plebes pane potitur.</p>
      <p class="i16">Lucilius.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>All the common departments of the Deities are to be set aside, as
  inconsistent and idle. Pollux will be found a judge; Ceres, a law-giver;
  Bacchus, the God of the year; Neptune, a physician; and Æsculapius, the
  God of thunder: and this not merely from the poets; but from the best
  mythologists of the Grecians, from those who wrote professedly upon the
  subject.</p>

  <p>I have observed before, that the Grecians in foreign words often
  changed the Nu final to Sigma. For Keren, they wrote <span title="Keras" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>; for Cohen, <span
  title="Kôês" class="grk">&#x39A;&#x3C9;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>; for Athon,
  <span title="Athôs" class="grk">&#x391;&#x3B8;&#x3C9;&#x3C2;</span>; for
  Boun, <span title="Bous" class="grk">&#x392;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>;
  for Sain, <span title="Saïs" class="grk"
  >&#x3A3;&#x3B1;&#x3CA;&#x3C2;</span>.</p>

  <p>People, of old, were styled the children of the God whom they
  worshipped: hence they were, at last, thought to have been his real
  offspring; and he was looked up to as the true parent. On the contrary,
  Priests were represented as foster-fathers to the Deity before whom they
  ministered; and Priestesses were styled <span title="tithênai" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>, or nurses.</p>

  <p>Colonies always went out under the patronage and title of some Deity.
  This conducting-God was in after-times supposed to have been the real
  leader.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the whole merit of a transaction was imputed to this Deity
  solely; who was represented under the character of Perseus, Dionusus, or
  Hercules. Hence, instead of one person, we must put a people; and the
  history will be found consonant to the truth.</p>

  <p>As the Grecians made themselves principals in many great occurrences
  which were of another country, we must look abroad for the original, both
  of their rites and mythology; and apply to the nations from whence they
  were derived. Their original history was foreign, and ingrafted upon the
  history of the country where they settled. This is of great consequence,
  and repeatedly to be considered.</p>

  <p>One great mistake frequently prevails among people who deal in these
  researches, which must be carefully avoided. We should never make use of
  a language which is modern, or comparatively modern, to deduce the
  etymology of antient and primitive terms. Pezron applies to the modern
  Teutonic, which he styles the Celtic, and says, was the language of
  Jupiter. But who was Jupiter, and what has the modern Celtic to do with
  the history of Egypt or Chaldea? There was an interval of two thousand
  years between the times of which he treats and any history of the Celtæ:
  and there is still an interval, not very much inferior to the former,
  before we arrive at the æra of the language to which he applies.</p>

  <p>It has been the custom of those writers, who have been versed in the
  Oriental languages, to deduce their etymologies from roots; which are
  often some portion of a verb. But the names of places and of persons are
  generally an assemblage of qualities and titles; such as I have exhibited
  in the treatise above; and I believe were never formed by such
  evolutions. The terms were obvious, and in common use; taken from some
  well-known characteristics. Those who imposed such names never thought of
  a root; and, probably, did not know the purport of the term. Whoever,
  therefore, in etymology, has recourse to this method of investigation,
  seems to me to act like a person who should seek at the fountain-head for
  a city which stood at the mouth of a river.</p>

<h4>A</h4>

<h3>SHORT ACCOUNT</h3>

<h4>OF THE</h4>

<h2>HELLADIANS,</h2>

<h4>AND THEIR ORIGIN;</h4>

<h4><i>In order to obviate some Objections.</i></h4>

  <p>As I have mentioned that the Helladians came from Egypt, and the east;
  it may be proper to obviate an objection which may be made, to the
  account I give; as if it were contradictory to the tenor of the
  scriptures, as they are in general understood. Greece, and the islands of
  Greece, are continually supposed, from the account given by Moses<a
  name="footnotetag568" href="#footnote568"><sup>[568]</sup></a>, to have
  been peopled by the sons of Japhet; and there is scarce any body, either
  antient or modern, who has touched upon this subject, but has imagined
  Javan to have been the same as Ion, the son of Xuth, from whom the
  Ionians were descended. This latter point I shall not controvert at
  present. In respect to the former, the account given in the scriptures is
  undoubtedly most true. The sons of Japhet did people the isles of the
  Gentiles; by which is meant the regions of Greece and Europe, separated
  in great measure from the Asiatic continent by the intervention of the
  sea. They certainly were the first inhabitants of those countries. But
  the Helladians, though by family Ionians, were not of this race. They
  came afterwards; and all their best writers agree, that when their
  ancestors made their way into these provinces, they were possessed by a
  prior people. Who these were is no where uniformly said: only they agree
  to term them in general <span title="Barbaroi" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, or a
  rude, uncivilized people. As my system depends greatly upon this point;
  to take away every prejudice to my opinion, I will in some degree
  anticipate, what I shall hereafter more fully prove. I accordingly submit
  to the reader the following evidences; which are comparatively few, if we
  consider what might be brought to this purpose. These are to shew, that
  the Helladians were of a different race from the sons of Japhet: and that
  the country, when they came to it, was in the possession of another
  people: which people they distinguished from themselves by the title of
  <span title="Barbaroi" class="grk"

  <p>As the divine honours paid to the Sun, and the adoration of fire, were
  at one time almost universal, there will be found in most places a
  similitude in the terms of worship. And though this mode of idolatry took
  its rise in one particular part of the world, yet, as it was propagated
  to others far remote, the stream, however widely diffused, will still
  savour of the fountain. Moreover, as people were determined in the choice
  of their holy places by those preternatural phænomena, of which I have
  before taken notice; if there be any truth in my system, there will be
  uniformly found some analogy between the name of the temple, and its
  rites and situation: so that the etymology may be ascertained by the
  history of the place. The like will appear in respect to rivers and
  mountains; especially to those which were esteemed at all sacred, and
  which were denominated from the Sun and fire. I therefore flatter myself
  that the etymologies which I shall lay before the reader will not stand
  single and unsupported; but there will be an apparent analogy throughout
  the whole. The allusion will not be casual and remote, nor be obtained by
  undue inflexions and distortions: but, however complicated the name may
  appear, it will resolve itself easily into the original terms; and, when
  resolved, the truth of the etymology will be ascertained by the
  concomitant history. If it be a Deity, or other personage, the truth will
  appear from his office and department; or with the attributes imputed to
  him. To begin, then, with antient Latium. If I should have occasion to
  speak of the Goddess Feronia, and of the city denominated from her, I
  should deduce the from Fer-On, ignis Dei Solis; and suppose the place to
  have been addicted to the worship of the Sun, and the rites of fire. I
  accordingly find, from Strabo and Pliny, that rites of this sort were
  practised here: and one custom, which remained even to the time of
  Augustus, consisted in a ceremony of the priests, who used to walk
  barefoot over burning coals: <a name="footnotetag569"
  href="#footnote569"><sup>[569]</sup></a><span title="Gumnois gar posi diexiasin anthrakian, kai spodian megalên." class="grk"

  &#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;.</span> <i>The priests,
  with their feet naked, walked over a large quantity of live coals and
  cinders</i>. The town stood at the bottom of Mount Soracte, sacred to
  Apollo; and the priests were styled Hirpi. Aruns, in Virgil, in his
  address to Apollo, takes notice of this custom:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag570" href="#footnote570"><sup>[570]</sup></a>Summe Deûm, magni custos Soractis, Apollo,</p>
      <p>Quem primi colimus; cui pineus ardor acervo</p>

      <p>Cultores multâ premimus vestigia prunâ;</p>
      <p>Da, Pater.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The temple is said to have been founded on account of a pestilential
  <a name="footnotetag571" href="#footnote571"><sup>[571]</sup></a>vapour,
  which arose from a cavern; and to which some shepherds were conducted by
  (<span title="Lukos" class="grk"
  >&#x39B;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>) a wolf. Were I to attempt
  the decyphering of Ferentum, I should proceed in a manner analogous to
  that above. I should suppose it to have been named <i>Fer-En, ignis, vel
  Solis fons</i>, from something peculiar either in its rites or situation.
  I accordingly find, that there was a sacred fountain, whose waters were
  styled Aquæ Ferentinæ,&mdash;cui numen etiam, et divinus cultus tributus
  <a name="footnotetag572" href="#footnote572"><sup>[572]</sup></a>fuit.
  Here was a grove, equally sacred, mentioned by <a name="footnotetag573"
  href="#footnote573"><sup>[573]</sup></a> Livy, and others; where the
  antient Latines used to hold their chief assemblies. As this grand
  meeting used to be in a place denominated from fire, it was the cause of
  those councils being called Feriæ Latinæ. The fountain, which ran through
  the grove, arose at the foot of mount <a name="footnotetag574"
  href="#footnote574"><sup>[574]</sup></a>Albanus, and afterwards formed
  many <a name="footnotetag575"
  href="#footnote575"><sup>[575]</sup></a>pools.</p>

  <p>The antient Cuthites, and the Persians after them, had a great
  veneration for fountains and streams; which also prevailed among other
  nations, so as to have been at one time almost universal. Of this regard
  among the Persians Herodotus takes notice: <a name="footnotetag576"
  href="#footnote576"><sup>[576]</sup></a><span title="Sebontai potamous tôn pantôn malista" class="grk"

  &#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>: <i>Of all
  things in nature they reverence rivers most</i>. But if these rivers were
  attended with any nitrous or saline quality, or with any fiery eruption,
  they were adjudged to be still more sacred, and ever distinguished with
  some title of the Deity. The natives of Egypt had the like veneration.
  <i>Other nations</i>, says <a name="footnotetag577"
  href="#footnote577"><sup>[577]</sup></a>Athanasius, <i>reverenced rivers
  and fountains; but, above all people in the world, the Egyptians held
  them in the highest honour, and esteemed them as divine.</i> Julius
  Firmicus gives the same account of them. <a name="footnotetag578"
  href="#footnote578"><sup>[578]</sup></a>Ægyptii aquæ beneficium
  percipientes aquam colunt, aquis supplicant. From hence the custom passed
  westward to Greece, Italy, and the extremities of Europe. In proof of
  which the following inscription is to be found in Gruter:</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><a name="footnotetag579" href="#footnote579"><sup>[579]</sup></a>Vascaniæ in Hispaniâ<br />
FONTI DIVINO.</p>

  <p>How much it prevailed among the Romans we learn from Seneca. <a
  name="footnotetag580" href="#footnote580"><sup>[580]</sup></a>Magnorum
  fluviorum capita veneramur&mdash;coluntur aquarum calentium fontes; et
  quædam stagna, quæ vel opacitas, vel immensa altitudo sacravit. It
  mattered not what the nature of the water might be, if it had a peculiar
  quality. At Thebes, in Ammonia, was a fountain, which was said to have
  been cold by day, and warm at night. <span title="Hê krênê" class="grk"

  &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5; &#x1F21;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;.</span> <i>It
  was named the fountain of the Sun.</i> In Campania was a fountain Virena;
  which I should judge to be a compound of Vir-En, and to signify ignis
  fons, from being dedicated to the Deity of fire, on account of some
  particular quality. I accordingly find in <a name="footnotetag582"
  href="#footnote582"><sup>[582]</sup></a>Vitruvius, that it was a
  medicinal spring, and of a strong vitriolic nature. The Corinthians had
  in their Acropolis a <a name="footnotetag583"
  href="#footnote583"><sup>[583]</sup></a>Pirene, of the same purport as
  Virena, just mentioned. It was a beautiful fountain sacred to Apollo,
  whose <a name="footnotetag584"
  href="#footnote584"><sup>[584]</sup></a>image was at the head of the
  water within a sacred inclosure.</p>

  <p>We read of a Pyrene, which was a fountain of another nature; yet of
  the same etymology, however differently expressed. It was a mountain, and
  gave name to the vast ridge called Saltus Pyrenæi. It is undoubtedly a
  compound of <a name="footnotetag585"
  href="#footnote585"><sup>[585]</sup></a>Pur-ain, and signifies a fountain
  of fire. I should imagine, without knowing the history of the country,
  that this mountain once flamed; and that the name was given from this
  circumstance. Agreeably to this, I find, from Aristotle de Mirabilibus,
  that here was formerly an eruption of fire. The same is mentioned by
  Posidonius in Strabo; and also by Diodorus, who adds, <a
  name="footnotetag586" href="#footnote586"><sup>[586]</sup></a><span

  the mountains from hence had the name of Pyrenæi.</i> Mount Ætna is
  derived very truly by Bochart from Aituna, fornax; as being a reservoir
  of molten matter. There was another very antient name, Inessus; by which
  the natives called the hill, as well as the city, which was towards the
  bottom of it. The name is a compound of Ain-Es, like Hanes in Egypt; and
  signifies a fountain of fire. It is called Ennesia by Diodorus, who says
  that this name was afterwards changed to Ætna. He speaks of the city; but
  the name was undoubtedly borrowed from the mountain, to which it was
  primarily applicable, and upon which it was originally conferred: <a

  Ain-Es, fons ignis sive lucis. It was the same as the Arab Heliopolis,

  href="#footnote590"><sup>[590]</sup></a>from whom he borrows, renders it

  nearer to the real name. The historian, however, points it out plainly,
  by saying, that it was three days journey from Mount <a
  name="footnotetag591" href="#footnote591"><sup>[591]</sup></a>Casius; and
  that the whole way was through the Arabian desert. This is a situation
  which agrees with no other city in all Egypt, except that which was the
  Onium of the later Jews. With this it accords precisely. There seem to
  have been two cities named On, from the worship of the Sun. One was
  called Zan, Zon, and Zoan, in the land of Go-zan, the <a
  name="footnotetag592" href="#footnote592"><sup>[592]</sup></a>Goshen of
  the scriptures. The other was the city On in Arabia; called also Hanes.

  translated <a name="footnotetag594"
  href="#footnote594"><sup>[594]</sup></a>Heliopolis; which has caused
  great confusion in the history of Egypt. The latter of the two was the
  Iänis, or <span title="Ianisos" class="grk"
  >&#x399;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, of the Greeks;
  so called from Hanes, the great fountain of light, the Sun; who was
  worshipped under that title by the Egyptians and Arabians. It lies now
  quite in ruins, close to the village Matarea, which has risen from it.
  The situation is so pointed out, that we cannot be mistaken: and we find,
  moreover, which is a circumstance very remarkable, that it is at this day
  called by the Arabians Ain El Sham, the fountain of the Sun; a name
  precisely of the same purport as Hanes. Of this we are informed by the
  learned geographer, D'Anville, and others; though the name, by different
  travellers, is expressed with some variation. <a name="footnotetag595"
  href="#footnote595"><sup>[595]</sup></a>Cette ville presque ensévelie
  sous des ruines, et voisine, dit Abulfeda, d'un petit lieu nommé Matarea,
  conserve dans les géographies Arabes le nom d'Ainsiems ou du fontain du
  Soleil. A like account is given by Egmont and <a name="footnotetag596"
  href="#footnote596"><sup>[596]</sup></a>Hayman; though they express the
  name Ain El Cham; a variation of little consequence. The reason why the
  antient name has been laid aside, by those who reside there, is
  undoubtedly this. Bochart tells us, that, since the religion of Mahomet
  has taken place, the Arabs look upon Hanes as the devil: <a
  name="footnotetag597" href="#footnote597"><sup>[597]</sup></a>proinde ab
  ipsis ipse Dæmon <span lang="he" title="HNAS" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D4;&#x5E0;&#x5D0;&#x5E1;</bdo></span> vocatur. Hence they
  have abolished Hanes: but the name Ain El Cham, of the same purport, they
  have suffered to remain.</p>

  <p>I have before taken notice of an objection liable to be made from a
  supposition, that if Hanes signified <i>the fountain of light</i>, as I
  have presumed, it would have been differently expressed in the Hebrew.
  This is a strange fallacy; but yet very predominant. Without doubt those
  learned men, who have preceded in these researches, would have bid fair
  for noble discoveries, had they not been too limited, and biassed, in
  their notions. But as far as I am able to judge, most of those, who have
  engaged in inquiries of this nature, have ruined the purport of their
  labours through some prevailing prejudice. They have not considered, that
  every other nation, to which we can possibly gain access, or from whom we
  have any history derived, appears to have expressed foreign terms
  differently from the natives, in whose language they were found. And
  without a miracle the Hebrews must have done the same. We pronounce all
  French names differently from the people of that country: and they do the
  same in respect to us. What we call London, they express Londres: England
  they style Angleterre. What some call Bazil, they pronounce Bal: Munchen,
  Munich: Mentz, Mayence: Ravenspurg, Ratisbon. The like variation was
  observable of old. Carthago of the Romans was Carchedon among the Greeks.
  Hannibal was rendered Annibas: Asdrubal, Asdroubas: and probably neither
  was consonant to the Punic mode of expression. If then a prophet were to
  rise from the dead, and preach to any nation, he would make use of terms
  adapted to their idiom and usage; without any retrospect to the original
  of the terms, whether they were domestic, or foreign. The sacred writers
  undoubtedly observed this rule towards the people, for whom they wrote;
  and varied in their expressing of foreign terms; as the usage of the
  people varied. For the Jewish nation at times differed from its
  neighbours, and from itself. We may be morally certain, that the place,
  rendered by them Ekron, was by the natives called Achoron; the Accaron,
  <span title="Akkarôn" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BA;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, of Josephus,
  and the Seventy. What they termed Philistim, was Pelestin: Eleazar, in
  their own language, they changed to Lazar, and Lazarus: and of the Greek
  <span title="sunedrion" class="grk"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>
  they formed Sanhedrim. Hence we may be certified, that the Jews, and
  their ancestors, as well as all nations upon earth, were liable to
  express foreign terms with a variation, being led by a natural
  peculiarity in their mode of speech. They therefore are surely to be
  blamed, who would deduce the orthography of all antient words from the
  Hebrew; and bring every extraneous term to that test. It requires no
  great insight into that language to see the impropriety of such
  procedure. Yet no prejudice has been more <a name="footnotetag598"
  href="#footnote598"><sup>[598]</sup></a>common. The learned Michaelis has
  taken notice of this <a name="footnotetag599"
  href="#footnote599"><sup>[599]</sup></a>fatal attachment, and speaks of
  it as a strange illusion. He says, that <i>it is the reigning influenza,
  to which all are liable, who make the Hebrew their principal study</i>.
  The only way to obtain the latent purport of antient terms is by a fair
  analysis. This must be discovered by an apparent analogy; and supported
  by the history of the place, or person, to whom the terms relate. If such
  helps can be obtained, we may determine very truly the etymology of an
  Egyptian or Syriac name; however it may appear repugnant to the
  orthography of the Hebrews. The term Hanes is not so uncommon as may be
  imagined. Zeus was worshipped under this title in Greece, and styled
  <span title="Zeus Ainêsios" class="grk">&#x396;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;
  &#x391;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. The
  Scholiast upon Apollonius Rhodius mentions his temple, and terms it <a

  also taken notice of by Strabo, who speaks of a mountain Hanes, where the
  temple stood. <a name="footnotetag601"

  <p>Aineïus, and Ainesius are both alike from Hanes, the Deity of Egypt,
  whose rites may be traced in various parts. There were places named
  Aineas, and Ainesia in Thrace; which are of the same original. This title
  occurs sometimes with the prefix Ph'anes: and the Deity so called was by
  the early theologists thought to have been of the highest antiquity. They
  esteemed him the same as <a name="footnotetag602"
  href="#footnote602"><sup>[602]</sup></a>Ouranus, and Dionusus: and went
  so far as to give him a creative <a name="footnotetag603"
  href="#footnote603"><sup>[603]</sup></a>power, and to deduce all things
  from him. The Grecians from Phanes formed <span title="Phanaios" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, which they
  gave as a title both to <a name="footnotetag604"
  href="#footnote604"><sup>[604]</sup></a>Zeus, and Apollo. In this there
  was nothing extraordinary, for they were both the same God. In the north
  of Italy was a district called Ager <a name="footnotetag605"
  href="#footnote605"><sup>[605]</sup></a>Pisanus. The etymology of this
  name is the same as that of Hanes, and Phanes; only the terms are
  reversed. It signifies ignis fons: and in confirmation of this etymology
  I have found the place to have been famous for its hot streams, which are
  mentioned by Pliny under the name of Aquæ Pisanæ. Cuma in Campania was
  certainly denominated from Chum, heat, on account of its soil, and
  situation. Its medicinal <a name="footnotetag606"
  href="#footnote606"><sup>[606]</sup></a>waters are well known; which were
  called Aquæ Cumanæ. The term Cumana is not formed merely by a Latine
  inflection; but consists of the terms Cumain, and signifies a hot
  fountain; or a fountain of Chum, or Cham, the Sun. The country about it
  was called Phlegra; and its waters are mentioned by Lucretius.</p>

  <p>Here was a cavern, which of old was a place of prophecy. It was the
  seat of the Sibylla Cumana, who was supposed to have come from <a

  As Cuma was properly Cuman; so Baiæ was Baian; and Alba near mount
  Albanus<a name="footnotetag609" href="#footnote609"><sup>[609]</sup></a>,
  Alban: for the Romans often dropped the n final. Pisa, so celebrated in
  Elis, was originally Pisan, of the same purport as the Aquæ Pisanæ above.
  It was so called from a sacred fountain, to which only the name can be
  primarily applicable: and we are assured by Strabo <a
  name="footnotetag610" href="#footnote610"><sup>[610]</sup></a><span

  &#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>, that the
  fountain had certainly the name of Pisan. I have mentioned that Mount
  Pyrene was so called from being a fountain of fire: such mountains often
  have hot streams in their vicinity, which are generally of great utility.
  Such we find to have been in Aquitania at the foot of this mountain,
  which were called Thermæ Onesæ; and are mentioned by Strabo, as <a

  the world was termed Cumana, was in another rendered Comana. There was a
  grand city of this name in Cappadocia, where stood one of the noblest
  Puratheia in Asia. The Deity worshipped was represented as a feminine,
  and styled Anait, and Anaïs; which latter is the same as Hanes. She was
  well known also in Persis, Mesopotamia, and at Egbatana in Media. Both
  An-ait, and An-ais, signifies a fountain of fire. Generally near her
  temples, there was an eruption of that element; particularly at Egbatana,
  and Arbela. Of the latter Strabo gives an account, and of the fiery
  matter which was near it. <a name="footnotetag612"

  <p>I should take the town of Egnatia in Italy to have been of the same
  purport as Hanes above mentioned: for Hanes was sometimes expressed with
  a guttural, Hagnes; from whence came the ignis of the Romans. In Arcadia
  near mount Lyceus was a sacred fountain; into which one of the nymphs,
  which nursed Jupiter, was supposed to have been changed. It was called
  Hagnon, the same as Ain-On, the fount of the Sun. From Ain of the
  Amonians, expressed Agn, came the <span title="hagnos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F01;&#x3B3;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> of the Greeks, which
  signified any thing pure and clean; purus sive castus. Hence was derived
  <span title="hagneion, pêgaion; hagnaion, katharon; hagnê, kathara" class="grk"

  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>: as we may learn from
  Hesychius. Pausanias styles the fountain <a name="footnotetag613"
  href="#footnote613"><sup>[613]</sup></a>Hagno: but it was originally
  Hagnon, the fountain of the Sun: hence we learn in another place of
  Hesychius, <span title="hagnopoleisthai, to hupo hêliou theresthai." class="grk"

  Egnatia, which I mentioned above, stood in campis Salentinii, and at this
  day is called Anazo, and Anazzo. It was so named from the rites of fire:
  and that those customs were here practised, we may learn from some
  remains of them among the natives in the times of Horace and Pliny. The
  former calls the place by contraction <a name="footnotetag614"

  <p>Horace speaks as if they had no fire: but according to Pliny they

  Salentum, which is a compound of Sal-En, Solis fons; and arose from this
  sacred fire to which the Salentini pretended. They were Amonians, who
  settled here, and who came last from Crete <a name="footnotetag616"

  might be brought from Sicily: for this island abounded with places, which
  were of Amonian original. Thucydides and other Greek writers, call them
  Phenicians<a name="footnotetag617"
  href="#footnote617"><sup>[617]</sup></a>: <span title="Ôkoun de kai Phoinikes peri pasan men Sikelian" class="grk"

  &#x3A3;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>. But they
  were a different people from those, which he supposes. Besides, the term
  Phenician was not a name, but a title: which was assumed by people of
  different parts; as I shall shew. The district, upon which the Grecians
  conferred it, could not have supplied people sufficient to occupy the
  many regions, which the Phenicians were supposed to have possessed. It
  was an appellation, by which no part of Canaan was called by the antient
  and true inhabitants: nor was it ever admitted, and in use, till the
  Grecians got possession of the coast. It was even then limited to a small
  tract; to the coast of Tyre and Sidon.</p>

  <p>If so many instances may be obtained from the west, many more will be
  found, as we proceed towards the east; from whence these terms were
  originally derived. Almost all the places in Greece were of oriental
  etymology; or at least from Egypt. I should suppose that the name of
  Methane in the Peloponnesus had some relation to a fountain, being
  compounded of Meth-an, the fountain of the Egyptian Deity, Meth, whom the
  Greeks called <span title="Mêtis" class="grk"

  <p>We learn from <a name="footnotetag619"
  href="#footnote619"><sup>[619]</sup></a>Pausanias, that there was in this
  place a temple and a statue of Isis, and a statue also of Hermes in the
  forum; and that it was situated near some hot springs. We may from hence
  form a judgment, why this name was given, and from what country it was
  imported. We find this term sometimes compounded Meth-On, of which name
  there was a town in <a name="footnotetag620"
  href="#footnote620"><sup>[620]</sup></a>Messenia. Instances to our
  purpose from Greece will accrue continually in the course of our
  work.</p>

  <p>One reason for holding waters so sacred arose from a notion, that they
  were gifted with supernatural powers. Jamblichus takes notice of many
  ways, by which the gift of divination was to be obtained. <a
  name="footnotetag621"
  href="#footnote621"><sup>[621]</sup></a><i>Some</i>, says he, <i>procure
  a prophetic spirit by drinking the sacred water, as is the practice of
  Apollo's priest at Colophon. Some by sitting over the mouth of the
  cavern, as the women do, who give out oracles at Delphi. Others are
  inspired by the vapour, which arises from the waters; as is the case of
  those who are priestesses at Branchidæ</i>. He adds,<a
  name="footnotetag622" href="#footnote622"><sup>[622]</sup></a> <i>in
  respect to the oracle at Colophon, that the prophetic spirit was supposed
  to proceed from the water. The fountain, from whence it flowed, was in an
  apartment under ground; and the priest went thither to partake of the
  emanation</i>. From this history of the place we may learn the purport of
  the name, by which this oracular place was called. Colophon is Col-Oph
  On, tumulus Dei Solis Pythonis, and corresponds with the character given.
  The river, into which this fountain ran, was sacred, and named Halesus;
  it was also called <a name="footnotetag623"
  href="#footnote623"><sup>[623]</sup></a>Anelon: An-El-On, Fons Dei Solis.
  Halesus is composed of well-known titles of the same God.</p>

  <p>Delos was famed for its oracle; and for a fountain sacred to the
  prophetic Deity. It was called <a name="footnotetag624"
  href="#footnote624"><sup>[624]</sup></a>Inopus. This is a plain compound
  of Ain-Opus, Fons Pythonis. Places named Asopus, Elopus, and like, are of
  the same analogy. The God of light, Orus, was often styled Az-El; whence
  we meet with many places named Azelis, Azilis, Azila, and by apocope,
  Zelis, Zela, and Zeleia. In Lycia was the city Phaselis, situated upon
  the mountain <a name="footnotetag625"
  href="#footnote625"><sup>[625]</sup></a>Chimæra; which mountain had the
  same name, and was sacred to the God of fire. Phaselis is a compound of
  Phi, which, in the Amonian language, is a mouth or opening; and of Azel
  above mentioned. Ph'Aselis signifies Os Vulcani, sive apertura ignis; in
  other words a chasm of fire. The reason why this name was imposed may be
  seen in the history of the place<a name="footnotetag626"
  href="#footnote626"><sup>[626]</sup></a>. Flagrat in Phaselitide Mons
  Chimæra, et quidem immortali diebus, et noctibus flammâ. Chimæra is a
  compound of Cham-Ur, the name of the Deity, whose altar stood towards the
  top of the <a name="footnotetag627"
  href="#footnote627"><sup>[627]</sup></a>mountain. At no great distance
  stood Mount Argaius, which was a part of the great ridge, called Taurus.
  This Argaius may be either derived from Har, a mountain; or from Aur,
  fire. We may suppose Argaius to signify Mons cavus: or rather <i>ignis
  cavitas</i>, sive <i>Vulcani domus</i>, a name given from its being
  hollow, and at the same time a reservoir of fiery matter. The history of
  the mountain may be seen in Strabo; who says, that it was immensely high,
  and ever covered with snow; it stood in the vicinity of Comana,
  Castabala, Cæsarea, and Tyana: and all the country about it abounded with
  fiery <a name="footnotetag628"
  href="#footnote628"><sup>[628]</sup></a>eruptions. But the most
  satisfactory idea of this mountain may be obtained from coins, which were
  struck in its vicinity; and particularly <a name="footnotetag629"
  href="#footnote629"><sup>[629]</sup></a>describe it, both as an hollow
  and an inflamed mountain.</p>

  <p>In Thrace was a region called Pæonia, which seems to have had its name
  from P'Eon, the God of light<a name="footnotetag630"
  href="#footnote630"><sup>[630]</sup></a>. The natives of these parts were
  styled both Peonians and Pierians; which names equally relate to the Sun.
  Agreeably to this Maximus Tyrius tells us, that they particularly
  worshipped that luminary: and adds, that they had no image; but instead
  of it used to suspend upon an high pole a disk of metal, probably of fine
  gold, as they were rich in that mineral: and before this they performed
  their <a name="footnotetag631"
  href="#footnote631"><sup>[631]</sup></a>adoration.</p>

  <p>There is an apparent analogy between the names of places farther east;
  whose inhabitants were all worshippers of the Sun. Hence most names are
  an assemblage of his titles. Such is Cyrestia, Chalybon, Comana, Ancura,
  Cocalia, Cabyra, Arbela, Amida, Emesa, Edessa, and the like. Emesa is a
  compound of Ham-Es: the natives are said by Festus Avienus to have been
  devoted to the Sun:</p>

  <p>Similar to Emesa was Edessa, or more properly Adesa, so named from
  Hades, the God of light. The emperor Julian styles the region&mdash;<span

  <p>There were many places called Arsene, Arsine, Arsinoë, Arsiana. These
  were all the same name, only varied in different countries; and they were
  consequently of the same purport. Arsinoë is a compound of arez-ain,
  Solis fons: and most places so denominated will be found famed for some
  fountain. One of this name was in Syria; <a name="footnotetag636"

  <i>Arsinoë is a city in Syria, situated upon a rising ground, out of
  which issue many streams: from hence the city had its name</i>. Arsine
  and Arsiana in Babylonia had <a name="footnotetag637"
  href="#footnote637"><sup>[637]</sup></a>fountains of bitumen. Arsene in

  Arsinoë near <a name="footnotetag640"

  <p>There were many people called Hyrcani; and cities and regions,
  Hyrcania: in the history of which there will be uniformly found some
  reference to fire. The name is a compound of Ur-chane, the God of that
  element. He was worshipped particularly at Ur, in Chaldea: and one tribe
  of that nation were called Urchani. Strabo mentions them as only one
  branch of the <a name="footnotetag641"
  href="#footnote641"><sup>[641]</sup></a>literati; but <a
  name="footnotetag642" href="#footnote642"><sup>[642]</sup></a>Pliny
  speaks of them as a people, a tribe of the Chaldeans. Here was the source
  of fire worship: and all the country was replete with bitumen and fire.
  There was a region <a name="footnotetag643"
  href="#footnote643"><sup>[643]</sup></a>Hyrcania, inhabited by the Medes;
  which seems to have been of the same inflammable nature. The people were
  called Hyrcani, and Astabeni: which latter signifies the sons of fire.
  Celiarius mentions a city Hyrcania in <a name="footnotetag644"
  href="#footnote644"><sup>[644]</sup></a>Lydia. There were certainly
  people styled Hyrcani; and a large plain called Campus Hyrcanus <a
  name="footnotetag645" href="#footnote645"><sup>[645]</sup></a> in the
  same part of the world. It seems to have been a part of that parched and
  burning region called <span title="katakekaumenê" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>,
  so named from the fires with which it abounded. It was near Hierapolis,
  Caroura, and Fossa Charonea; all famed for fire.</p>

  <p>It may seem extraordinary, yet I cannot help thinking, that the
  Hercynian forest in Germany was no other than the Hurcanian, and that it
  was denominated from the God Urcan, who was worshipped here as well as in
  the east. It is mentioned by Eratosthenes and Ptolemy, under the name of
  <span title="drumos Orkunios" class="grk"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x39F;&#x3C1;&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, or the
  forest of <a name="footnotetag646"
  href="#footnote646"><sup>[646]</sup></a>Orcun; which is, undoubtedly, the
  same name as that above. I have taken notice, that the name of the
  mountain Pyrene signified a fountain of fire, and that the mountain had
  once flamed. There was a Pyrene among the Alpes <a name="footnotetag647"
  href="#footnote647"><sup>[647]</sup></a>Tridentini, and at the foot of it
  a city of the same <a name="footnotetag648"
  href="#footnote648"><sup>[648]</sup></a>name; which one would infer to
  have been so denominated from the like circumstance. I mention this,
  because here was the regio Hercynia, where the Hercynian forest<a
  name="footnotetag649" href="#footnote649"><sup>[649]</sup></a> commenced,
  and from which it received its name. Beatus Rhenanus, in his account of
  these parts, says, that there was a tradition of this mountain Pyrene
  once<a name="footnotetag650" href="#footnote650"><sup>[650]</sup></a>
  burning: and, conformably to this notion, it is still distinguished by
  the name of the great <a name="footnotetag651"
  href="#footnote651"><sup>[651]</sup></a>Brenner. The country, therefore,
  and the forest may have been called Orcunian upon this account. For as
  the worship of the Sun, the Deity of fire, prevailed greatly at places of
  this nature, I make no doubt but Hercynia, which Ptolemy expresses <span
  title="Orkunia" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C1;&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> was so named
  from Or-cun, the God of that element.</p>

  <p>We must not be surprised to find Amonian names among the Alpes; for
  some of that family were the first who passed them. The merit of great
  performances was by the Greeks generally attributed to a single person.
  This passage therefore through the mountains is said by some to have been
  the work of Hercules: by others of Cottus, and <a name="footnotetag652"
  href="#footnote652"><sup>[652]</sup></a>Cottius. From hence this
  particular branch of the mountains had the name of Alpes Cottiae; and the
  country was called Regio Cottiana: wherein were about twelve capital <a
  name="footnotetag653" href="#footnote653"><sup>[653]</sup></a>cities.
  Some of that antient and sacred nation, the Hyperboreans, are said by
  Posidonius to have taken up their residence in these parts. <a
  name="footnotetag654" href="#footnote654"><sup>[654]</sup></a><span

  the Taurini: and one of the chief cities was Comus. Strabo styles the
  country the land of <a name="footnotetag655"
  href="#footnote655"><sup>[655]</sup></a>Ideonus, and Cottius. These names
  will be found hereafter to be very remarkable. Indeed many of the Alpine
  appellations were Amonian; as were also their rites: and the like is to
  be observed in many parts of Gaul, Britain, and Germany. Among other
  evidences the worship of Isis, and of her sacred ship, is to be noted;
  which prevailed among the Suevi. <a name="footnotetag656"
  href="#footnote656"><sup>[656]</sup></a>Pars Suevorum et Isidi
  sacrificat: unde causa et origo peregrino sacro, parum comperi; nisi quod
  signum ipsum in modum Liburnæ figuratum docet advectam religionem. The
  ship of Isis was also reverenced at Rome: and is marked in the <a
  name="footnotetag657" href="#footnote657"><sup>[657]</sup></a>calendar
  for the month of March. From whence the mystery was derived, we may learn
  from <a name="footnotetag658"
  href="#footnote658"><sup>[658]</sup></a>Fulgentius. Navigium Isidis
  Ægyptus colit. Hence we find, that the whole of it came from Egypt. The
  like is shewn by <a name="footnotetag659"
  href="#footnote659"><sup>[659]</sup></a>Lactantius. To this purpose I
  could bring innumerable proofs, were I not limited in my progress. I may
  perhaps hereafter introduce something upon this head, if I should at any
  time touch upon the antiquities of Britain and Ireland; which seem to
  have been but imperfectly known. Both of these countries, but especially
  the latter, abound with sacred terms, which have been greatly overlooked.
  I will therefore say so much in furtherance of the British Antiquarian,
  as to inform him, that names of places, especially of hills,
  promontories, and rivers, are of long duration; and suffer little change.
  The same may be said of every thing, which was esteemed at all sacred,
  such as temples, towers, and high mounds of earth; which in early times
  were used for altars. More particularly all mineral and medicinal waters
  will be found in a great degree to retain their antient names: and among
  these there may be observed a resemblance in most parts of the world. For
  when names have been once determinately affixed, they are not easily
  effaced. The Grecians, who under Alexander settled in Syria, and
  Mesopotamia, changed many names of places, and gave to others
  inflections, and terminations after the mode of their own country. But
  Marcellinus, who was in those parts under the Emperor Julian, assures us,
  that these changes and variations were all cancelled: and that in his
  time the antient names prevailed. Every body, I presume, is acquainted
  with the history of Palmyra, and of Zenobia the queen; who having been
  conquered by the emperor Aurelian, was afterwards led in triumph. How
  much that city was beautified by this princess, and by those of her
  family, may be known by the stately ruins which are still extant. Yet I
  have been assured by my late excellent and learned friend Mr. Wood, that
  if you were to mention Palmyra to an Arab upon the spot, he would not
  know to what you alluded: nor would you find him at all more acquainted
  with the history of Odænatus, and Zenobia. Instead of Palmyra he would
  talk of Tedmor; and in lieu of Zenobia he would tell you, that it was
  built by Salmah Ebn Doud, that is by Solomon the son of David. This is
  exactly conformable to the account in the scriptures: for it is said in
  the Book of Chronicles, <a name="footnotetag660"
  href="#footnote660"><sup>[660]</sup></a><i>He also</i> (Solomon) <i>built
  Tadmor in the wilderness</i>. The Grecian name Palmyra, probably of two
  thousand years standing, is novel to a native Arab.</p>

  <p>As it appeared to me necessary to give some account of the rites, and
  worship, in the first ages, at least in respect to that great family,
  with which I shall be principally concerned, I took this opportunity at
  the same time to introduce these etymological inquiries. This I have done
  to the intent that the reader may at first setting out see the true
  nature of my system; and my method of investigation. He will hereby be
  able to judge beforehand of the scope which I pursue; and of the terms on
  which I found my analysis. If it should appear that the grounds, on which
  I proceed, are good, and my method clear, and warrantable, the subsequent
  histories will in consequence of it receive great illustration. But
  should it be my misfortune to have my system thought precarious, or
  contrary to the truth, let it be placed to no account, but be totally set
  aside: as the history will speak for itself; and may without these helps
  be authenticated.</p>

  <p>As soon as religion began to lose its purity, it degenerated very
  fast; and, instead of a reverential awe and pleasing sense of duty, there
  succeeded a fearful gloom and unnatural horror, which were continually
  augmented as superstition increased. Men repaired in the first ages
  either to the lonely summits of mountains, or else to caverns in the
  rocks, and hollows in the bosom of the earth; which they thought were the
  residence of their Gods. At the entrance of these they raised their
  altars and performed their vows. Porphyry takes notice how much this mode
  of worship prevailed among the first nations upon the earth: <a

  process of time they began to erect temples, they were still determined
  in their situation by the vicinity of these objects, which they
  comprehended within the limits of the sacred inclosure. These melancholy
  recesses were esteemed the places of the highest sanctity: and so greatly
  did this notion prevail, that, in aftertimes, when this practice had
  ceased, still the innermost part of the temple was denominated the
  <i>cavern</i>. Hence the Scholiast upon Lycophron interprets the words
  <span title="par' antra" class="grk">&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;'

  name="footnotetag670" href="#footnote670"><sup>[670]</sup></a>Samacon, in
  Elis; and, like the above, consecrated to the nymphs. There were likewise
  medicinal waters, from which people troubled with cutaneous and
  scrofulous disorders found great benefit. I have mentioned the temple at
  Hierapolis in <a name="footnotetag671"
  href="#footnote671"><sup>[671]</sup></a>Phrygia; and the chasm within its
  precincts, out of which there issued a pestilential vapour. There was a
  city of the same name in <a name="footnotetag672"
  href="#footnote672"><sup>[672]</sup></a>Syria, where stood a temple of
  the highest antiquity; and in this temple was a fissure, through which,
  according to the tradition of the natives, the waters at the deluge
  retired. Innumerable instances might be produced to this purpose from
  Pausanias, Strabo, Pliny, and other writers.</p>

  <p>It has been observed, that the Greek term <span title="koilos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, hollow, was often
  substituted for Coëlus, heaven: and, I think, it will appear to have been
  thus used from the subsequent history, wherein the worship of the
  Atlantians is described. The mythologists gave out, that Atlas supported
  heaven: one reason for this notion was, that upon mount Atlas stood a
  temple to Coëlus. It is mentioned by Maximus Tyrius in one of his
  dissertations, and is here, as in many other instances, changed to <span
  title="koilos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, hollow. The temple
  was undoubtedly a cavern: but the name is to be understood in its
  original acceptation, as Coël, the house of God; to which the natives
  paid their adoration. This mode of worship among the Atlantian betrays a
  great antiquity; as the temple seems to have been merely a vast hollow in
  the side of the mountain; and to have had in it neither image, nor
  pillar, nor stone, nor any material object of adoration: <a

  the house of God; equivalent to C&#339;lus of the Romans. To this the
  people made their offerings: and this was the heaven which Atlas was
  supposed to support. It seems to have been no uncommon term among the
  Africans. There was a city in Libya named Coël, which the Romans rendered
  Coëlu. They would have expressed it Coelus, or C&#339;lus; but the name
  was copied in the time of the Punic wars, before the s final was admitted

    <h4>Pl. II. <i>Temple of Mithras near Naki Rustan in Persia. Also
    temples in the rock near the Plain of the Magi.</i> From Le Bruyn.</h4>
  </div>
  <p>Among the Persians most of the temples were caverns in rocks, either
  formed by nature, or artificially produced. They had likewise Puratheia,
  or open temples, for the celebration of the rites of fire. I shall
  hereafter shew, that the religion, of which I have been treating, was
  derived from the sons of Chus: and in the antient province of Chusistan,
  called afterwards Persis, there are to be seen at this day many curious
  monuments of antiquity, which have a reference to that worship. The
  learned Hyde supposes them to have been either <a name="footnotetag675"
  href="#footnote675"><sup>[675]</sup></a>palaces, or tombs. The chief
  building, which he has taken for a palace, is manifestly a Puratheion;
  one of those open edifices called by the Greeks <span title="Hupaithra" class="grk"
  >&#x1F59;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>. It is very
  like the temple at Lucorein in upper Egypt, and seems to be still entire.
  At a glance we may perceive, that it was never intended for an
  habitation. At a distance are some sacred grottos, hewn out of the rock;
  the same which he imagines to have been tombs. Many of the antients, as
  well as of the moderns, have been of the same opinion. In the front of
  these grottos are representations of various characters: and among others
  is figured, more than once, a princely personage, who is approaching the
  altar where the sacred fire is <a name="footnotetag676"
  href="#footnote676"><sup>[676]</sup></a>burning. Above all is the Sun,
  and the figure of a Deity in a cloud, with sometimes a sacred bandage, at
  other times a serpent entwined round his middle, similar to the Cnuphis
  of Egypt. Hyde supposes the figure above to be the soul of the king, who
  stands before the altar: but it is certainly an emblem of the Deity, of
  which we have a second example in Le <a name="footnotetag677"
  href="#footnote677"><sup>[677]</sup></a>Bruyn, copied from another part
  of these edifices. Hyde takes notice, that there were several repetitions
  of this history, and particularly of persons, solem et ignem in pariete
  delineatos intuentes: yet he forms his judgment from one specimen only.
  These curious samples of antient architecture are described by <a
  name="footnotetag678" href="#footnote678"><sup>[678]</sup></a>Kæmpfer, <a
  name="footnotetag679" href="#footnote679"><sup>[679]</sup></a>Mandesloe,
  <a name="footnotetag680" href="#footnote680"><sup>[680]</sup></a>Chardin,
  and <a name="footnotetag681" href="#footnote681"><sup>[681]</sup></a>Le
  Bruyn. They are likewise taken notice of by <a name="footnotetag682"
  href="#footnote682"><sup>[682]</sup></a>Thevenot, and Herbert. In respect
  to the grottos I am persuaded, that they were temples, and not tombs.
  Nothing was more common among the Persians than to have their temples
  formed out of rocks. Mithras e <a name="footnotetag683"
  href="#footnote683"><sup>[683]</sup></a>Petrâ was in a manner a proverb.
  Porphyry assures us, that the Deity had always a rock or cavern for his
  temple: that people, in all places, where the name of Mithras was known,
  paid their worship at a <a name="footnotetag684"
  href="#footnote684"><sup>[684]</sup></a>cavern. Justin Martyr speaks to
  the same <a name="footnotetag685"
  href="#footnote685"><sup>[685]</sup></a>purpose: and Lutatius Placidus
  mentions that this mode of worship began among the Persians, <a
  name="footnotetag686" href="#footnote686"><sup>[686]</sup></a>Persæ in
  spelæis coli solem primi invenisse dicuntur. There is therefore no reason
  to think that these grottos were tombs; or that the Persians ever made
  use of such places for the sepulture of their kings. The tombs of <a
  name="footnotetag687" href="#footnote687"><sup>[687]</sup></a>Cyrus, <a
  name="footnotetag688" href="#footnote688"><sup>[688]</sup></a>Nitocris,
  and other oriental princes, were within the precincts of their cities:
  from whence, as well as from the devices upon the entablatures of these
  grottos, we may be assured that they were designed for temples. Le Bruyn
  indeed supposes them to have been places of burial; which is very natural
  for a person to imagine, who was not acquainted with the antient worship
  of the people. Thevenot also says, that he <a name="footnotetag689"
  href="#footnote689"><sup>[689]</sup></a>went into the caverns, and saw
  several stone coffins. But this merely conjectural: for the things, to
  which he alludes, were not in the shape of coffins, and had undoubtedly
  been placed there as cisterns for water, which the Persians used in their
  nocturnal lustrations. This we may, in great measure, learn from his own
  words: for he says, that these reservoirs were square, and had a near
  resemblance to the basons of a fountain. The hills, where these grottos
  have been formed, are probably the same, which were of old famous for the
  strange echoes, and noises heard upon them. The circumstance is mentioned
  by Clemens Alexandrinus<a name="footnotetag690"
  href="#footnote690"><sup>[690]</sup></a>, who quotes it from the writers,
  who treated of the Persic history. It seems that there were some sacred
  hills in Persis, where, as people passed by, there were heard shouts, as
  of a multitude of people: also hymns and exultations, and other uncommon
  noises. These sounds undoubtedly proceeded from the priests at their
  midnight worship: whose voices at that season were reverberated by the
  mountains, and were accompanied with a reverential awe in those who heard
  them. The country below was called <span title="Chôra tôn Magôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;&#x3B1; &#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, the region of the Magi.</p>

  <p>The principal building also, which is thought to have been a palace,
  was a temple; but of a different sort. The travellers above say, that it
  is called Istachar: and Hyde repeats it, and tells us, that it signifies
  e rupe sumptum, seu rupe constans saxeum palatium: and that it is derived
  from the Arabic word sachr, rupes, in the eighth <a name="footnotetag691"
  href="#footnote691"><sup>[691]</sup></a>conjugation. I am sorry, that I
  am obliged to controvert this learned man's opinion, and to encounter him
  upon his own ground, about a point of oriental etymology. I am entirely a
  stranger to the Persic, and Arabic languages; yet I cannot acquiesce in
  his opinion. I do not think that the words e rupe sumptum, vel rupe
  constans saxeum palatium, are at any rate materials, out of which a
  proper name could be constructed. The place to be sure, whether a palace,
  or a temple, is built of stone taken from the quarry, or rock: but what
  temple or palace is not? Can we believe that they would give as a proper
  name to one place, what was in a manner common to all; and choose for a
  characteristic what was so general and indeterminate? It is not to be
  supposed. Every symbol, and representation relates to the worship of the
  country: and all history shews that such places were sacred, and set
  apart for the adoration of fire, and the Deity of that element, called
  Ista, and Esta.<a name="footnotetag692"
  href="#footnote692"><sup>[692]</sup></a> Ista-char, or Esta-char is the
  place or temple of Ista or Esta; who was the Hestia, <span title="Hestia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F19;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>, of the Greeks, and Vesta of
  the Romans. That the term originally related to fire we have the
  authority of Petavius. <a name="footnotetag693"
  href="#footnote693"><sup>[693]</sup></a>Hebraïcâ linguâ <span lang="he"
  title="ASH" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5E9;</bdo></span> ignem significat,

  >&#x1F19;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span> originem deduxerunt.
  Herbert, therefore, with great propriety, supposes the building to have
  been the temple of <a name="footnotetag694"
  href="#footnote694"><sup>[694]</sup></a>Anaia, or Anaïs; who was the same
  as Hanes, as well as Hestia. Procopius, speaking of the sacred fire of
  the Persians, says expressly, that it was the very same which in
  aftertimes the Romans worshipped, and called the fire of Hestia, or
  Vesta. <a name="footnotetag695"

  <p>Hyde renders the term after Kæmpfer, Ista: but it was more commonly
  expressed Esta, and Asta. The Deity was also styled Astachan, which as a
  masculine signified Sol Dominus, sive Vulcanus Rex. This we may infer
  from a province in Parthia, remarkable for eruptions of fire, which was
  called <a name="footnotetag697"
  href="#footnote697"><sup>[697]</sup></a>Asta-cana, rendered by the Romans
  Astacene, the region of the God of fire. The island Delos was famous for
  the worship of the sun: and we learn from Callimachus, that there were
  traditions of subterraneous fires bursting forth in many parts of it.</p>

  think, we may know for certain the purport of the term Istachar, which
  was a name given to the grand Pureion in Chusistan from the Deity there
  worshipped. It stands near the bottom of the hills with the caverns in a
  widely-extended plain: which I make no doubt is the celebrated plain of
  the magi mentioned above by Clemens. We may from these data venture to
  correct a mistake in Maximus Tyrius, who in speaking of fire-worship
  among the Persians, says, that it was attended with acclamations, in
  which they invited the Deity to take his repast<a name="footnotetag702"

  <p>There was a city of the same name in Eub&#339;a, expressed Carystus,
  where the stone <a name="footnotetag706"
  href="#footnote706"><sup>[706]</sup></a>Asbestus was found. Of this they
  made a kind of cloth, which was supposed to be proof against fire, and to
  be cleansed by that element. The purport of the name is plain; and the
  natural history of the place affords us a reason why it was imposed. For
  this we are obliged to Solinus, who calls the city with the Grecian
  termination, Carystos; and says, that it was noted for its hot streams:
  <a name="footnotetag707" href="#footnote707"><sup>[707]</sup></a>Carystos
  aquas calentes habet, quas <span title="Ellopias" class="grk"
  >&#x395;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span> vocant.
  We may therefore be assured, that it was called Car-ystus from the Deity
  of fire, to whom all hot fountains were sacred. Ellopia is a compound of
  El Ope, Sol Python, another name of the same Deity. Carystus, Cerastis,
  Cerasta, are all of the same purport: they betoken a place, or temple of
  Astus, or Asta, the God of fire. Cerasta in the feminine is expressly the
  same, only reversed, as Astachar in Chusistan. Some places had the same
  term in the composition of their names, which was joined with Kur; and
  they were named in honour of the Sun, styled <span title="Kuros" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Curos. He was worshipped all
  over Syria; and one large province was hence named Curesta, and
  Curestica, from <span title="Kur Hestos" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3C1; &#x1F19;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Sol
  Hestius.</p>

  <p>In Cappadocia were many Puratheia; and the people followed the same
  manner of worship, as was practised in Persis. The rites which prevailed,
  may be inferred from the names of places, as well as from the history of
  the country. One city seems to have been denominated from its tutelary
  Deity, and called Castabala. This is a plain compound of Ca-Asta-Bala,
  the place or temple of Asta Bala; the same Deity, as by the Syrians was
  called Baaltis. Asta Bala was the Goddess of fire: and the same customs
  prevailed here as at Feronia in Latium. The female attendants in the
  temple used to walk with their feet bare over burning <a
  name="footnotetag708" href="#footnote708"><sup>[708]</sup></a>coals.</p>

  <p>Such is the nature of the temple named Istachar; and of the caverns in
  the mountains of Chusistan. They were sacred to Mithras, and were made
  use of for his rites. Some make a distinction between Mithras, Mithres,
  and Mithra: but they were all the same Deity, the <a
  name="footnotetag709" href="#footnote709"><sup>[709]</sup></a>Sun,
  esteemed the chief God of the Persians. In these gloomy recesses people
  who were to be initiated, were confined for a long season in the dark,
  and totally secluded from all company. During this appointed term they
  underwent, as some say, eighty kinds of trials, or tortures, by way of
  expiation. <a name="footnotetag710"
  href="#footnote710"><sup>[710]</sup></a>Mithra apud Persas Sol esse
  existimatur: nemo vero ejus sacris initiari potest, nisi per aliquot
  suppliciarum gradus transierit. Sunt tormentorum ij lxxx gradus, partim
  intensiores.&mdash;Ita demum, exhaustis omnibus tormentis, sacris
  imbuuntur. Many <a name="footnotetag711"
  href="#footnote711"><sup>[711]</sup></a>died in the trial: and those who
  survived were often so crazed and shaken in their intellects, that they
  never returned to their former state of mind.</p>

  <p>Some traces of this kind of penance may be still perceived in the
  east, where the followers of Mahomet have been found to adopt it. In the
  history given by Hanway of the Persian monarch, Mir Maghmud, we have an
  account of a process similar to that above, which this prince thought
  proper to undergo. He was of a sour and cruel disposition, and had been
  greatly dejected in his spirits; on which account he wanted to obtain
  some light and assistance from heaven. <a name="footnotetag712"
  href="#footnote712"><sup>[712]</sup></a><i>With this intent Maghmud
  undertook to perform the spiritual exercises which the Indian
  Mahommedans, who are more addicted to them than those of other countries,
  have introduced into Kandahar. This superstitious practice is observed by
  shutting themselves up fourteen or fifteen days in a place where no light
  enters. The only nourishment they take is a little bread and water at
  sun-set. During this retreat they employ their time in repeating
  incessantly, with a strong guttural voice, the word</i> Hou, <i>by which
  they denote one of the attributes of the Deity. These continual cries,
  and the agitations of the body with which they were attended, naturally
  unhinge the whole frame. When by fasting and darkness the brain is
  distempered, they fancy they see spectres and hear voices. Thus they take
  pains to confirm the distemper which puts them upon such trials</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Such was the painful exercise which Maghmud undertook in January
  this year; and for this purpose he chose a subterraneous vault. In the
  beginning of the next month, when he came forth, he was so pale,
  disfigured, and emaciated, that they hardly knew him. But this was not
  the worst effect of his devotion. Solitude, often dangerous to a
  melancholy turn of thought, had, under the circumstances of his
  inquietude, and the strangeness of his penance, impaired his reason. He
  became restless and suspicious, often starting</i>.&mdash;In one of these
  fits he determined to put to death the whole family of his predecessor,
  Sha Hussein; among whom were several brothers, three uncles, and seven
  nephews, besides that prince's children. All these, in number above an
  hundred, the tyrant cut to pieces with his own hand in the palace yard,
  where they were assembled for that bloody purpose. Two small children
  only escaped by the intervention of their father, who was wounded in
  endeavouring to screen them.</p>

  <p>The reverence paid to caves and grottos arose from a notion that they
  were a representation of the <a name="footnotetag713"
  href="#footnote713"><sup>[713]</sup></a>world; and that the chief Deity
  whom the Persians worshipped proceeded from a cave. Such was the
  tradition which they had received, and which contained in it matter of
  importance. Porphyry attributes the original of the custom to Zoroaster,
  whoever Zoroaster may have been; and says, that he first consecrated a
  natural cavern in Persis to Mithras, the creator and father of all
  things. He was followed in this practice by others, who dedicated to the
  Deity places of this <a name="footnotetag714"
  href="#footnote714"><sup>[714]</sup></a>nature; either such as were
  originally hollowed by nature, or made so by the art of man. Those, of
  which we have specimens exhibited by the writers above, were probably
  enriched and ornamented by the Achaimenidæ of Persis, who succeeded to
  the throne of Cyrus. They are modern, if compared with the first
  introduction of the worship; yet of high antiquity in respect to us. They
  are noble relics of Persic architecture, and afford us matter of great
  curiosity.</p>

<h4>OF THE</h4>

<h2>OMPHI,</h2>

<h4>AND OF</h4>

<h3>THE WORSHIP UPON HIGH PLACES.</h3>

  <p>The term Omphi is of great antiquity, and denotes an oracular
  influence, by which people obtained an insight into the secrets of
  futurity. I have taken notice with what reverence men in the first ages
  repaired to rocks and caverns, as to places of particular sanctity. Here
  they thought that the Deity would most likely disclose himself either by
  a voice, or a dream, or some other præternatural token. Many, for the
  same purpose, worshipped upon hills, and on the tops of high mountains;
  imagining that they hereby obtained a nearer communication with heaven.
  Hence we read, as far back as the days of Moses, concerning the high
  places in <a name="footnotetag715"
  href="#footnote715"><sup>[715]</sup></a>Canaan. And, under the kings of
  Israel and Judah, that the people <i>made their offerings in high
  places</i>. We are particularly told of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, that
  <i>he walked in the way of the <a name="footnotetag716"
  href="#footnote716"><sup>[716]</sup></a> kings of Israel; yea, and made
  his sons to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the
  heathen&mdash;and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and
  on the hills, and under every green tree</i>. And many times when a
  reformation was introduced under some of the wiser and better princes, it
  is still lamented by the sacred writer, that <a name="footnotetag717"
  href="#footnote717"><sup>[717]</sup></a> <i>the high places were not
  taken away: the people still offered, and burnt incense on the high
  places</i>. It is observable, when the king of Moab wanted to obtain an
  answer from God, that he took Balaam the prophet, and brought him to the
  <a name="footnotetag718" href="#footnote718"><sup>[718]</sup></a>high
  places of Baal. And, finding that he could not obtain his purpose there,
  he carried him into the field of Zophim unto the top of Pisgah; and from
  thence he again removed him to the top of Peor. In all these places <i>he
  erected seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every<a
  name="footnotetag719" href="#footnote719"><sup>[719]</sup></a> altar</i>.
  It is said of Orpheus, that he went with some of his disciples to meet
  Theiodamas, the son of Priam, and to partake in a sacrifice which he
  every year offered upon the summit of a high<a name="footnotetag720"
  href="#footnote720"><sup>[720]</sup></a> mountain. We are told by Strabo,
  that the Persians always performed their worship upon hills<a

  <p>The people of Cappadocia and Pontus observed the like method of
  worship: and, of all sacrifices, wherever exhibited upon high places,
  none, perhaps, ever equalled in magnificence that which was offered by
  Mithridates upon his war with the Romans. He followed the Persic modes of
  worship, as well as the mixed rites of the Chaldeans and Syrians. Hence
  he chose one of the highest mountains in his dominions: upon the top of
  which he reared an immense pile, equal in size to the summit on which it
  stood: and there he sacrificed to the God of armies&mdash;<a

  The pile was raised by his vassal princes: and the offerings, besides
  those customary, were wine, honey, oil, and every species of aromatics.
  The fire is said to have been perceived at the distance of near a
  thousand stadia. The Roman poet makes his hero choose a like situation
  for a temple which he erected to Venus; and for the grove which he
  dedicated to the manes of his father.</p>

  <p>In Japan most of their temples at this day are constructed upon
  eminences; and often upon the ascent of high mountains. They are all, <a
  name="footnotetag724" href="#footnote724"><sup>[724]</sup></a>says
  Kæmpfer, most sweetly seated: A curious view of the adjacent country, a
  spring and rivulet of clear water, and the neighbourhood of a grove with
  pleasant walks, being the necessary qualifications of those spots of
  ground where these holy structures are to be built: for they say that the
  Gods are extremely delighted with such high and pleasant places.</p>

  <p>This practice in early times was almost universal; and every <a
  name="footnotetag725" href="#footnote725"><sup>[725]</sup></a>mountain
  was esteemed holy. The people, who prosecuted this method of worship,
  enjoyed a soothing infatuation, which flattered the gloom of
  superstition. The eminences to which they retired were lonely, and
  silent; and seemed to be happily circumstanced for contemplation and
  prayer. They, who frequented them, were raised above the lower world; and
  fancied that they were brought into the vicinity of the powers of the
  air, and of the Deity who resided in the higher regions. But the chief
  excellence for which they were frequented, was the Omphi, expressed <span
  title="omphê" class="grk">&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B7;</span> by the
  Greeks, and interpreted <a name="footnotetag726"
  href="#footnote726"><sup>[726]</sup></a><span title="Theia klêdôn" class="grk"
  >&#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;
  &#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3B4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, vox divina, being
  esteemed a particular revelation from heaven. In short, they were looked
  upon as the peculiar places where God delivered his oracles. Hermæus in
  Plutarch expresses this term <span title="omphis" class="grk"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, omphis; and says, that it
  was the name of an Egyptian Deity: and he interprets it, I know not for
  what reason, <a name="footnotetag727"
  href="#footnote727"><sup>[727]</sup></a><span title="euergetês" class="grk"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>.
  The word truly rendered was Omphi or Amphi, the oracle of Ham; who,
  according to the Egyptian theology, was the same as the Sun, or Osiris.
  He was likewise revered as the chief Deity by the Chaldeans; and by most
  nations in the east. He was styled both Ham, and Cham: and his oracles
  both Omphi and Ompi. In consequence of this, the mountains where they
  were supposed to be delivered, came to be denominated Har-al-Ompi; which
  al-ompi by the Greeks was changed to <span title="Olumpos" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Olympus; and
  the mountain was called <span title="oros Olumpou" class="grk"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x39F;&#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>. There were many
  of this name. The Scholiast upon Apollonius reckons up <a
  name="footnotetag728" href="#footnote728"><sup>[728]</sup></a>six: but
  there were certainly more, besides a variety of places styled upon the
  same account <a name="footnotetag729"
  href="#footnote729"><sup>[729]</sup></a>Olympian. They were all looked
  upon to be prophetic; and supposed to be the residence of the chief
  Deity, under whatever denomination he was specified, which was generally
  the God of light. For these oracles no place was of more repute than the
  hill at Delphi, called Omphi-El, or the oracle of the Sun. But the
  Greeks, who changed Al-omphi to Olympus, perverted these terms in a
  manner still more strange: for finding them somewhat similar in sound to
  a word in their own language, their caprice immediately led them to think
  of <span title="omphalos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, a navel, which
  they substituted for the original word. This they did uniformly in all
  parts of the world; and always invented some story to countenance their
  mistake. Hence, whenever we meet with an idle account of a navel, we may
  be pretty sure that there is some allusion to an oracle. In respect to
  Delphi, they presumed that it was the umbilicus, or centre of the whole
  earth. The poets gave into this notion without any difficulty; Sophocles
  calls it <a name="footnotetag730"

  &#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>: and Euripides
  avers that it was the precise centre of the earth:</p>

  <p>But supposing that this name and character had some relation to
  Delphi, how are we to account for other places being called after this
  manner? They could not all be umbilical: the earth cannot be supposed to
  have different centres: nor could the places thus named be always so
  situated, as to be central in respect to the nation, or the province in
  which they were included. Writers try to make it out this way: yet they
  do not seem satisfied with the process. The contradictory accounts shew
  the absurdity of the notion. It was a term borrowed from Egypt, which was
  itself an Omphalian region. Horus Apollo not knowing the meaning of this
  has made Egypt the centre of the earth: <a name="footnotetag736"

  Ætolians were styled umbilical; and looked upon themselves as the central
  people in Greece, like those of Delphi. But this notion was void of all
  truth in every instance which has been produced: and arose from a wrong
  interpretation of antient terms. What the Grecians styled Omphalus was
  certainly Ompha-El, the same as Al-Ompha; and related to the oracle of
  Ham or the Sun: and these temples were Prutaneia, and Puratheia, with a
  tumulus or high altar, where the rites of fire were in antient times
  performed. As a proof of this etymology most of the places styled
  Olympian, or Omphalian, will be found to have a reference to an oracle.
  Epirus was celebrated for the oracle at Dodona: and we learn from the
  antient poet, Reianus, that the natives were of old called
  Omphalians:</p>

  the Sun, or El; and likewise Or, the same as Orus; his oracles were in

  Urphi.</p>

  <p>I have taken notice of several cities called Omphalian, and have
  observed, that they generally had oracular temples: but by the Greeks
  they were universally supposed to have been denominated from a navel.
  There was a place called <a name="footnotetag746"

  another in Crete, which had a celebrated <a name="footnotetag747"

  that is mentioned by Strabo, as being upon mount Ida, where was the city
  Elorus. Diodorus speaks of this oracle, named Omphalian; but supposes
  that the true name was <span title="omphalos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, omphalus: and

  <p>Who would imagine, that one of the wisest nations that ever existed
  could rest satisfied with such idle figments: and how can we account for
  these illusions, which overspread the brightest minds? We see knowing and
  experienced people inventing the most childish tales; lovers of science
  adopting them; and they are finally recorded by the grave historian: all
  which would not appear credible, had we not these evidences so
  immediately transmitted from them. And it is to be observed that this
  blindness is only in regard to their religion; and to their mythology,
  which was grounded thereupon. In all other respects they were the wisest
  of the sons of men.</p>

  <p>We meet in history with other places styled Omphalian. The temple of
  Jupiter Ammon was esteemed of the highest antiquity, and we are informed
  that there was an omphalus here; and that the Deity was worshipped under
  the form of a navel. Quintus Curtius, who copied his history from the
  Greeks, gives us in the life of Alexander the following strange account,
  which he has embellished with some colouring of his own. <a
  name="footnotetag750" href="#footnote750"><sup>[750]</sup></a>Id, quod
  pro Deo colitur, non eandem effigiem habebat, quam vulgo Diis Artifices
  accommodârunt. <i>Umbilico</i> maxime similis est habitus, smaragdo, et
  gemmis, coagmentatus. Hunc, cum responsum petitur, navigio aurato gestant
  Sacerdotes, multis argenteis <i>pateris</i> ab utroque navigii latere
  pendentibus. The whole of this is an abuse of terms, which the author did
  not understand, and has totally misapplied. One would imagine that so
  improbable a story, as that of an umbilical Deity with his silver basons,
  though patched up with gold and emeralds, would have confuted itself. Yet
  Schottus in his notes upon Curtius has been taken with this motly
  description: and in opposition to all good history, thinks that this idle
  story of a navel relates to the compass. Hyde too has adopted this
  notion; and proceeds to shew how each circumstance may be made to agree
  with the properties of the magnet. <a name="footnotetag751"
  href="#footnote751"><sup>[751]</sup></a>Illa nempe Jovis effigies videtur
  semiglobulare quiddam, uti est compassus marinus, formâ umbilici

  propter ejusdem divinum auxilium: utpote in quo index magneticus erat
  sicut intus existens quidam deus, navigiorum cursum in medio æquore
  dirigens. These learned men were endued with a ready faith: and not only
  acquiesce in what they have been told, but contribute largely to
  establish the mistake. The true history is this. Most places in which was
  the supposed oracle of a Deity, the Grecians, as I have before mentioned,
  styled Olympus, Olympia, and Olympiaca: or else Omphale, and Omphalia,
  and the province <span title="chôrion Omphalion" class="grk"

  &#x39F;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>. These
  terms were thought to relate to a navel: but, if such an interpretation
  could have been made to correspond with the history of any one place, yet
  that history could not have been reiterated; nor could places so widely
  distant have all had the same reference. What was terminated <span
  title="omphalos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> was <a
  name="footnotetag752" href="#footnote752"><sup>[752]</sup></a>Omph-El,
  the oracle of God, the seat of divine influence: and Al-Omphi was a name
  given to mountains and eminences upon the same account. An oracle was
  given to Pelias in Thessaly: and whence did it proceed? from the well
  wooded omphalus of his mother Earth.</p>

  <p>In other words, it proceeded from the stately grove of Hestia, where
  stood an oracular temple.</p>

  <p>In respect to the omphalus of Ammon, which Curtius has translated
  umbilicus, and garnished with gold and jewels, the whole arises from a
  mistake in terms, as in the many instances before. It was Omphi El, the
  oracle of Ham, or the Sun: and the shrine, from whence it was supposed to
  proceed, was carried in a boat. The Pateræ, represented as so many silver
  basons, were in reality the interpreters of the oracle. They were the
  priests, who in the sacred processions walked on each side, and supported
  both the image and the boat in which it was carried. They are said to
  have been eighty in number; and they pretended to bear the Deity about,
  just as they were by the divine impulse directed. <i>The God</i>, says <a
  name="footnotetag754" href="#footnote754"><sup>[754]</sup></a>Diodorus
  Siculus, <i>is carried about in a ship of gold by eighty of his priests.
  They bear him upon their shoulders, and pursue their way by instinct,
  just as the divine automaton chances to direct them.</i> These persons,
  who thus officiated, were probably the same as the Petipharæ of the
  antient Egyptians, but were called Pateræ by the Greeks. It was a name,
  and office, by which the priests of Delphi, and of many other places
  besides those in Egypt, were distinguished: and the term always related
  to oracular interpretation. Hence Bochart describes these priests, and
  their function, very justly. <a name="footnotetag755"
  href="#footnote755"><sup>[755]</sup></a>Pateræ Sacerdotes Apollinis,
  oraculorum interpretes. Pator, or Petor, was an Egyptian word; and Moses
  speaking of Joseph, and the dreams of Pharaoh, more than once makes use
  of it in the sense above. It occurs Genesis. c. 41. v. 8.&mdash;v. 13.
  and manifestly alludes to an interpretation of that divine intercourse,
  which the Egyptians styled Omphi. This was communicated to Pharaoh by a
  dream: for the Omphi was esteemed not only a verbal response, but also an
  intimation by <a name="footnotetag756"
  href="#footnote756"><sup>[756]</sup></a>dreams&mdash;<span title="Omphê, phêmê theia, theia klêdôn&mdash;oneirou phantasmata." class="grk"

  the oracles of Hecate, wherein the Gods are represented, as insensibly
  wafted through the air like an Omphean vision.</p>

  <p>These Omphean visions were explained by Joseph; he interpreted the

  Hesych. Petrus Hebræo sermone agnoscens notat. Arator. From these
  examples we may, I think, learn that the priest was styled Petor, and
  Pator: and that it was the place, which properly was called Patora. The
  Colossal statue of Memnon in the Thebaïs was a Patora, or oracular image.
  There are many inscriptions upon different parts of it; which were copied
  by Dr. Pocock<a name="footnotetag758"
  href="#footnote758"><sup>[758]</sup></a>, and are to be seen in the first
  volume of his travels. They are all of late date in comparison of the
  statue itself; the antiquity of which is very great. One of these
  inscriptions is particular, and relates to the Omphi, which seems to have
  frightened away some ill-disposed people in an attempt to deface the
  image:</p>

  name="footnotetag760" href="#footnote760"><sup>[760]</sup></a>prophet
  resided, was of the same nature; and that by Pethor and Pethora was meant
  a place of interpretation, or oracular temple. There was probably a
  college of priests; such as are mentioned to have existed among the
  Amonians: of whom Balaam had been by the king of Moab appointed chief
  Petora, or priest. It seems to have been the celebrated place in Arabia,
  famous in after times for the worship of Alilat, and called by the Romans
  <a name="footnotetag761"
  href="#footnote761"><sup>[761]</sup></a>Petra.</p>

  <p>The custom of carrying the Deity in a shrine, placed in a boat, and
  supported by priests, was in use among the Egyptians, as well as the <a
  name="footnotetag762" href="#footnote762"><sup>[762]</sup></a>Ammonites.
  It is a circumstance which deserves our notice; as it appears to be very
  antient, and had doubtless a mysterious allusion. We have three curious
  examples of it among <a name="footnotetag763"
  href="#footnote763"><sup>[763]</sup></a>Bishop Pocock's valuable
  specimens of antiquity, which he collected in those parts. He met with
  them at Luxorein, or <a name="footnotetag764"
  href="#footnote764"><sup>[764]</sup></a>Lucorein, near Carnac, in the
  Thebaïs; but mentions not what they relate to: nor do I know of any
  writer who has attended to their history. The accounts given above by
  Curtius, and Diodorus, are wonderfully illustrated by these
  representations from Egypt. It is plain that they all relate to the same
  religious ceremony, and very happily concur to explain each other. It may
  be worth observing, that the originals whence these copies were taken are
  of the highest antiquity; and, probably, the most early specimens of
  sculpture in the world. Diodorus mentions that the shrine of Ammon had
  eighty persons to attend it: but Dr. Pocock, when he took these copies,
  had not time to be precisely accurate in this article. In his specimens
  the greatest number of attendants are twenty: eighteen support the boat,
  and one precedes with a kind of sceptre; another brings up the rear,
  having in his hand a rod, or staff, which had undoubtedly a mystic
  allusion. The whole seems to have been emblematical; and it will be
  hereafter shewn, that it related to a great preservation, which was most
  religiously recorded, and became the principal subject of all their
  mysteries. The person in the shrine was their chief ancestor, and the
  whole process was a memorial of the deluge; the history of which must
  have been pretty recent when these works were executed in Egypt.</p>

  <p>From the shrines of Amon abovementioned we may derive the history of
  all oracles; which, from the Deity by whom they were supposed to be
  uttered, were called Omphi and Amphi, as I have shewn: also, Alphi,
  Elphi, Orphi, Urphi, from El, and Orus. The Greeks adhered religiously to
  antient terms, however obsolete and unintelligible. They retained the
  name of Amphi, though they knew not the meaning: for it was antiquated
  before they had letters. That it originally related to oracular
  revelation is plain from its being always found annexed to the names of
  places famous on that account; and from its occurring in the names of
  men, renowned as priests and augurs, and supposed to have been gifted
  with a degree of foreknowledge. We read of Amphiaraus, Amphilocus,
  Amphimachus, persons represented as under particular divine influence,
  and interpreters of the will of the Gods. Amphion, though degraded to a
  harper, was Amphi-On, the oracle of Apollo, the Sun: and there was a
  temple, one of the antient <span title="hupaithra" class="grk"
  >&#x1F51;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, dedicated to
  him and Zethus, as we may read in Pausanias. Mopsus, the diviner, is
  styled <span title="Ampukidês" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>,
  Ampucides; which is not a patronymic, but a title of the oracular
  Deity.</p>

  Minerva, heavenly wisdom, is by Lycophron styled <a name="footnotetag770"
  href="#footnote770"><sup>[770]</sup></a>Amphira; which is a compound of
  Amphi-Ur, the divine influence, or oracle of Orus. Of this name there was
  a city near Olympia in Elis: for many places were in this manner
  denominated, on account of their being esteemed the seat of prophecy. In
  Phocis was the city Hyampolis: and close to it <a name="footnotetag771"
  href="#footnote771"><sup>[771]</sup></a> Amphissa, famous for the oracle
  of an unknown Goddess, the daughter of Macaria. Amphrysus, in
  B&#339;otia, was much famed for the influence of <a name="footnotetag772"
  href="#footnote772"><sup>[772]</sup></a> Apollo; and Amphimallus, in
  Crete, was well known for its <a name="footnotetag773"
  href="#footnote773"><sup>[773]</sup></a> oracle. Amphiclea, in <a
  name="footnotetag774" href="#footnote774"><sup>[774]</sup></a> Phocis,
  had Dionusus for its guardian Deity, whose orgies were there celebrated;
  and whose shrine was oracular.</p>

  <p>I imagine that this sacred influence, under the name of Amphi, is
  often alluded to in the exordia of Poets, especially by the writers in
  Dithyrambic measure, when they address Apollo. Taken in its usual sense
  (<span title="amphi" class="grk">&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;</span>
  circum) the word has no meaning: and there is otherwise no accounting for
  its being chosen above all others in the language to begin hymns of
  praise to this Deity, who was the principal God of prophecy. We have one
  instance of it in the Nubes of Aristophanes:</p>

  <p>These hymns were of late date, long after Homer; and were introduced
  in Ionia, and also in Cyprus and Phenicia, when the Grecians were in
  possession of those parts. They were used in the room of the antient
  hymns, which were not understood by the new inhabitants. One of them is
  confessedly addressed to the Goddess called Venus Ourania, in Cyprus; and
  was designed to be sung by the priest of that Goddess upon the stated
  festivals at Salamis.</p>

  <p>We may perceive, from what has been said, that the word Amphi was a
  term of long standing, the sense of which was no longer understood: yet
  the sound was retained by the Greeks, and used for a customary
  exclamation. In respect to the more antient exordia above quoted,
  especially that of Terpander, I take the words to be an imitation, rather
  than a translation, of a hymn sung at Delphi in the antient Amonian
  language; the sound of which has been copied, rather than the sense, and
  adapted to modern terms of a different meaning. I make no doubt but that
  there were many antient hymns preserved in those oracular temples, which
  were for a long time retained, and sung, when their meaning was very
  imperfectly known. They were, for the most part, composed in praise of
  Ham, or the Sun; and were sung by the Homeridæ, and Iämidæ. They were
  called after his titles, Ad, Athyr, Amphi, which the Grecians expressed
  Dithyrambi. They were strains of joy and exultation, attended with grand
  processions: and from the same term, dithyrambus, was derived the <span
  title="thriambos" class="grk"
  >&#x3B8;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> of the
  Greeks, and the triumphus of the Romans. We are informed that triumphs
  were first instituted by <a name="footnotetag780"
  href="#footnote780"><sup>[780]</sup></a>Bacchus, who was no other than
  Chus: the history, therefore, of the term must be sought for from among
  the Cuseans. That it was made up of titles, is plain, from its being said
  by Varro to have been a <a name="footnotetag781"
  href="#footnote781"><sup>[781]</sup></a>name; and one that was given by
  the Amonians among other personages to Dionusus: for they were not in
  this point uniform. Diodorus takes notice that it was a name, and
  conferred upon the person spoken of: <a name="footnotetag782"

  Greece, is called Iämus, and his priests Iämidæ. His oracle, in
  consequence of this, was styled Iämphi, and Iämbi, which was the same
  term as Amphi, of which we have been treating. From the name Iambi came
  the measure <span title="Iambos" class="grk"

  oracular. <a name="footnotetag784"

  <p>From hence we may be assured, that he was of old the real Deity of the
  place.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned, that in the sacred processions in early times the
  Deity used to be carried about in a shrine; which circumstance was always
  attended with shouts, and exclamations, and the whole was accompanied
  with a great concourse of people. The antient Greeks styled these
  celebrities the procession of the <a name="footnotetag787"
  href="#footnote787"><sup>[787]</sup></a>P'omphi, and from hence were
  derived the words <span title="pompê" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B7;</span>, and pompa. These originally
  related to a procession of the oracle: but were afterwards made use of to
  describe any cavalcade or show. In the time of Herodotus the word seems
  in some degree to have retained its true meaning, being by him used for
  the oracular influence. He informs us that Amphilutus was a diviner of
  Acharnan; and that he came to Pisistratus with a commission from heaven.
  By this he induced that prince to prosecute a scheme which he
  recommended. <a name="footnotetag788"

  &#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B7;</span> is a divine revelation, or
  commission. Ham was the Hermes of the Egyptians, and his oracle, as I
  have shewn, was styled Omphi: and when particularly spoken of as
  <i>the</i> oracle, it was expressed P'omphi, and P'ompi, the <span
  title="pompê" class="grk">&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B7;</span> of
  the Greeks. Hence Hermes had the name of <span title="pompaios" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, which
  was misinterpreted the messenger, and conductor: and the Deity was in

  dead. But <span title="pompaios" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> related

  >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B7;</span> was an oracle. An ox, or cow,

  <p>Many places were from the oracle styled P'ompean: and supposed by the
  Romans to have been so named from Pompeius Magnus; but they were too
  numerous, and too remote to have been denominated from him, or any other
  Roman. There was indeed Pompeiæ in Campania: but even that was of too
  high antiquity to have received its name from Rome. We read of Pompeiæ
  among the Pyrenees, Pompion in Athens, Pompelon in Spain, Pompeditha in
  Babylonia, Pomponiana in Gaul. There were some cities in Cilicia and
  Cappadocia, to which that Roman gave the name of Pompeipolis: but upon,
  inquiry they will be found to have been Zeleian cities, which were
  oracular: go that the Romans only gave a turn to the name in honour of
  their own countryman, by whom these cities were taken.</p>

  <p>Besides the cities styled Pompean, there were pillars named in like
  manner; which by many have been referred to the same person. But they
  could not have been built by him, nor were they erected to his memory: as
  I think we may learn from their history. There are two of this
  denomination still remaining at a great distance from each other: both
  which seem to have been raised for a religious purpose. The one stands in
  Egypt at <a name="footnotetag790"
  href="#footnote790"><sup>[790]</sup></a>Alexandria; the other at the
  extreme point of the Thracian Bosporus, where is a communication between
  the Propontis and the antient Euxine sea. They seem to be of great
  antiquity, as their basis witnesses at this day: the shaft and
  superstructure is of later date. The pillar at the Bosporus stands upon
  one of the Cyanean rocks: and its parts, as we may judge from <a
  name="footnotetag791" href="#footnote791"><sup>[791]</sup></a>Wheeler,
  betray a difference in their æra. It was repaired in the time of
  Augustus: and an inscription was added by the person who erected the
  column, and who dedicated the whole to that Emperor.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">
<a name="footnotetag792" href="#footnote792"><sup>[792]</sup></a>DIVO. CAESARI. AUGUSTO.<br />
E.. CL... ANDIDIUS...<br />
L. F CL. ARGENTO...
</p>

  <p>We may learn from the inscription, however mutilated, that this pillar
  was not the work of Pompeius Magnus; nor could it at all relate to his
  history: for the time of its being rebuilt was but little removed from
  the age in which he lived. The original work must have therefore been far
  prior. The pillar in Egypt is doubtless the same which was built upon the
  ruins of a former, by Sostratus of Cnidos, before the time of Pompeius:
  so that the name must have been given on another account. The inscription
  is preserved by <a name="footnotetag793"

  <p>The narrow streight into the Euxine sea was a passage of difficult
  navigation. This was the reason, that upon each side there were temples
  and sacred columns erected to the Deity of the country, in order to
  obtain his assistance. And there is room to think, that the pillars and
  obelisks were made use of for beacons, and that every temple was a
  Pharos. They seem to have been erected at the entrance of harbours; and
  upon eminences along the coasts in most countries. The pillars of
  Hercules were of this sort, and undoubtedly for the same purpose. They
  were not built by him; but erected to his honour by people who worshipped
  him, and who were called Herculeans. <a name="footnotetag794"

  is a kind of tower, and was raised by the people of Rhegium at the
  streight where the passage was to Sicily. Directly opposite stood another
  building of the same sort, called the tower of Pelorus.</i> Such Pillars
  were by the Iberians styled Herculean, because they were sacred to
  Hercules; under which title they worshipped the chief Deity. Some of
  these were near Gades, and Onoba<a name="footnotetag795"

  &#x399;&#x3B2;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>: others were
  erected still higher, on the coast of Lusitania. This caused an idle
  dispute between Eratosthenes, Dicæarchus, and <a name="footnotetag796"
  href="#footnote796"><sup>[796]</sup></a>others, in order to determine
  which were the genuine pillars of Hercules: as if they were not all
  equally genuine; all denominated from the Deity of the country. Two of
  the most celebrated stood upon each side of the Mediterranean at the
  noted passage called fretum Gaditanum&mdash;<span title="kata ta akra tou porthmou" class="grk"

  Mauritanian side was called Abyla, from Ab-El, parens Sol: the other in
  Iberia had the name of<a name="footnotetag797"
  href="#footnote797"><sup>[797]</sup></a> Calpe. This was an obelisk or
  tower, and a compound of Ca-Alpe, and signifies the house, or cavern of
  the same oracular God: for it was built near a cave; and all such
  recesses were esteemed to be oracular. At places of this sort mariners
  used to come on shore to make their offerings; and to inquire about the
  success of their voyage. They more especially resorted to those towers,
  and pillars, which stood at the entrance of their own havens. Nobody,
  says <a name="footnotetag798"
  href="#footnote798"><sup>[798]</sup></a>Arrian, will venture to quit his
  harbour without paying due offerings to the Gods, and invoking their
  favour. Helenus in Virgil charges Æneas, whatever may be the consequence,
  not to neglect consulting the oracle at Cuma.</p>

  <p>This island was greatly esteemed for its sanctity, and there used to
  be a wonderful concourse of people from all nations continually resorting
  to its temple. The priests, in consequence of it, had hymns composed in
  almost all languages. It is moreover said of the female attendants, that
  they could imitate the speech of various people; and were well versed in
  the histories of foreign parts, and of antient times. Homer speaks of
  these extraordinary qualifications as if he had been an eye-witness:</p>

  particularly of liba, or cakes, which were generally denominated from the
  temple where they were presented. A curious inscription to this purpose
  has been preserved by Spon and Wheeler, which belonged to some obelisk or
  temple upon the Thracian Bosporus. It was found on the Asiatic side,
  nearly opposite to the Pompean pillar, of which I before took notice. The

  <p>The more difficult the navigation was, the more places of sanctity
  were erected upon the coast. The Bosporus was esteemed a dangerous pass;
  and, upon that account, abounded with Cippi, and altars. These were
  originally mounds of earth, and sacred to the Sun: upon which account
  they were called Col-On, or altars of that Deity. From hence is derived
  the term Colona, and <span title="Kolônê" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>. It came at last to
  denote any <ins class="correction" title="'nees' in original">ness</ins>
  or foreland; but was originally the name of a sacred hill, and of the
  pillar which was placed upon it. To say the truth, there was of old
  hardly any headland but what had its temple or altar. The Bosporus, in
  particular, had numbers of them by way of sea-marks, as well as for
  sacred purposes: and there were many upon the coast of Greece. Hence
  Apollonius says of the Argonauts:</p>

  <p>These Colonæ were sacred to the Apollo of Greece; and, as they were
  sea-marks and beacons, which stood on eminences near the mouths of

  <p>It was not only upon rocks and eminences that these Cippi and Obelisks
  were placed by the antients: they were to be found in their temples,
  where for many ages a rude stock or stone served for a representation of
  the Deity. They were sometimes quite shapeless, but generally of a
  conical figure; of which we meet with many instances. Clemens
  Alexandrinus takes notice of this kind of <a name="footnotetag810"
  href="#footnote810"><sup>[810]</sup></a>worship: and Pausanias, in
  describing the temple of Hercules at Hyettus in <a name="footnotetag811"
  href="#footnote811"><sup>[811]</sup></a>B&#339;otia, tells us, that there
  was no statue in it, nor any work of art, but merely a rude stone, after
  the manner of the first ages. Tertullian gives a like description of
  Ceres and Pallas. Pallas Attica, et Ceres <a name="footnotetag812"
  href="#footnote812"><sup>[812]</sup></a>Phrygia&mdash;quæ sine effigie,
  rudi palo, et informi specie prostant. Juno of Samos was little better
  than a <a name="footnotetag813"
  href="#footnote813"><sup>[813]</sup></a>post. It sometimes happens that
  aged trees bear a faint likeness to the human fabric: roots, likewise,
  and sprays, are often so fantastic in their evolutions, as to betray a
  remote resemblance. The antients seem to have taken advantage of this
  fancied similitude, which they improved by a little art; and their first
  effort towards imagery was from these rude and rotten materials.
  Apollonius Rhodius, in his account of the Argonauts, gives a description
  of a monument of this sort, which was by them erected in a dark grove,
  upon a mountainous part of <a name="footnotetag814"
  href="#footnote814"><sup>[814]</sup></a>Bithynia. They raised an altar of
  rough stones, and placed near it an image of Rhea, which they formed from
  an arm or stump of an old vine.</p>

  <p>It is observable, that the Chinese, as well as the people of Japan,
  still retain something of this custom. When they meet with an uncouth
  root, or spray of a tree, they humour the extravagance: and, by the
  addition of a face, give it the look of a Joss or Bonzee, just as fancy
  directs them.</p>

  <p>The vine was esteemed sacred both to Dionusus, and Bacchus; for they
  were two different personages, though confounded by the Grecians: indeed
  the titles of all those, who were originally styled Baalim, are blended
  together. This tree had therefore the name of Ampel, which the Greeks
  rendered <span title="Ampelos" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, from the Sun,
  Ham, whose peculiar plant it was. This title is the same as Omphel before
  mentioned, and relates to the oracular Deity of the Pagan world; under
  which character Ham was principally alluded to. The Egyptian and Asiatic
  Greeks had some imperfect traditions about Ham, and Chus: the latter of
  which they esteemed Bacchus. And as the term Ampelus did not primarily
  relate to the vine, but was a sacred name transferred from the Deity,
  they had some notion of this circumstance: but as it was their custom out
  of every title to form a new personage, they have supposed Ampelus to
  have been a youth of great beauty, and one whom Bacchus particularly
  favoured. Hence Nonnus introduces the former begging of Selene not to
  envy him this happiness.</p>

  <p>In all these instances there are allusions to a history, which will
  hereafter be fully discussed. Ovid seems to make Ampelus a native of
  Thrace; and supposes him to have been the son of a satyr by one of the
  nymphs in that country:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag821" href="#footnote821"><sup>[821]</sup></a> Ampelon intonsum, Satyro Nymphâque creatum,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But however they may have mistaken this personage, it is certain that
  in early times he was well known, and highly reverenced. Hence wherever
  the Amonians settled, the name of Ampelus will occur: and many places
  will be found to have been denominated from the worship of the Deity
  under this sacred title. We learn from Stephanus Byzantinus, <a
  name="footnotetag822" href="#footnote822"><sup>[822]</sup></a><i>that,
  according to Hecatæus, in his Europa, Ampelus was the name of a city in
  Liguria. There was likewise a promontory in the district of Torone called
  Ampelus: a like promontory in Samos: another in Cyrene. Agr&#339;tas
  mentions two cities there, an upper, and a lower, of that name. There</i>
  <i>was likewise a harbour in Italy so called</i>. We read of a city <a
  name="footnotetag823" href="#footnote823"><sup>[823]</sup></a>Ampeloëssa
  in Syria, and a nation in Lybia called Ampeliotæ: <span title="Ampeliôtai de ethnos Libuês" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;

  &#x39B;&#x3B9;&#x3B2;&#x3C5;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>. Suidas. Also, Ampelona
  in Arabia; and a promontory, Ampelusia, near Tingis, in Mauritania. In
  all these places, however distant, the Amonians had made settlements.
  Over against the island Samos stood the sacred promontory, Mycale, in
  Ionia. This, too, was called Ampelus, according to Hesychius, as the
  passage is happily altered by Albertus and others. <span title="Ampelos, mêchanê, kai akra Mukalês, êgoun orous." class="grk"

  &#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span> one might infer, that Ampelus
  was no uncommon name for a mountain in general: so far is certain, that
  many such were so denominated: which name could not relate to <span
  title="ampelos" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, the vine; but
  they were so called from the Deity to whom they were <a
  name="footnotetag824" href="#footnote824"><sup>[824]</sup></a>sacred.
  Many of these places were barren crags, and rocks of the sea, ill suited
  to the cultivation of the <a name="footnotetag825"
  href="#footnote825"><sup>[825]</sup></a>vine. And not only eminences were
  so called, but the strand and shores, also, for the same reason: because
  here, too, were altars and pillars to this God. Hence we read in
  Hesychius: <span title="Ampelos&mdash;aigialos&mdash;Kurênaiois aigialos." class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;&mdash;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;&mdash;&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;

  Ampelus is signified the sea shore; or Ampelus, among the people of
  Cyrene, signifies the sea shore</i>.</p>

  <p>From what has been said, we may be assured that Ampelus and Omphalus
  were the same term originally, however varied afterwards and differently
  appropriated. They are each a compound from Omphe, and relate to the
  oracular Deity. Ampelus, at Mycale, in Ionia, was confessedly so
  denominated from its being a sacred<a name="footnotetag826"
  href="#footnote826"><sup>[826]</sup></a> place, and abounding with
  waters; by which, people who drank them were supposed to be inspired.
  They are mentioned in an antient oracle quoted by Eusebius<a
  name="footnotetag827" href="#footnote827"><sup>[827]</sup></a>: <span
  title="En Didumon gualois Mukalêsion ENTHEON hudôr." class="grk"

  &#x1F51;&#x3B4;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;.</span> I have mentioned that all fountains
  were esteemed sacred, but especially those which had any præternatural
  quality, and abounded with exhalations. It was an universal notion that a
  divine energy proceeded from these effluvia, and that the persons who
  resided in their vicinity were gifted with a prophetic quality. Fountains
  of this nature, from the divine influence with which they were supposed
  to abound, the Amonians styled Ain Omphe, sive fontes Oraculi. These
  terms, which denoted the fountain of the prophetic God, the Greeks
  contracted to <span title="Numphê" class="grk"
  >&#x39D;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B7;</span>, a Nymph; and supposed such a
  person to be an inferior Goddess, who presided over waters. Hot springs
  were imagined to be more immediately under the inspection of the nymphs:
  whence Pindar styles such fountains, <a name="footnotetag828"
  href="#footnote828"><sup>[828]</sup></a><span title="Therma Numphan loutra" class="grk"
  >&#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;
  &#x39D;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>. The temple of the
  Nymphæ Ionides, in Arcadia, stood close to a fountain of great <a
  name="footnotetag829" href="#footnote829"><sup>[829]</sup></a>efficacy.
  The term Nympha will be found always to have a reference to <a
  name="footnotetag830" href="#footnote830"><sup>[830]</sup></a>water.
  There was in the same region of the Peloponnesus a place called <span
  title="Numphas" class="grk"
  >&#x39D;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>, Nymphas; which was
  undoubtedly so named from its hot springs: <a name="footnotetag831"
  href="#footnote831"><sup>[831]</sup></a><span title="Katarrheitai gar hudati&mdash;Numphas" class="grk"

  <i>for Nymphas&mdash;abounded with waters</i>. Another name for these
  places was Ain-Ades, the fountain of Ades, or the Sun; which, in like
  manner, was changed to <span title="Naiades" class="grk"
  >&#x39D;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>, Naiades, a
  species of Deities of the same class. Fountains of bitumen, in Susiana
  and Babylonia, were called Ain-Aptha, the fountains of Aptha, the God of
  fire; which by the Greeks was rendered Naptha, a name given to <a
  name="footnotetag832" href="#footnote832"><sup>[832]</sup></a>bitumen. As
  they changed Ain Omphe to Numpha, a Goddess, they accordingly denominated
  the place itself <span title="Numpheion" class="grk"
  >&#x39D;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>,
  Nymphæum: and wherever a place occurs of that name, there will be found
  something particular in its circumstances. We are told by <a
  name="footnotetag833" href="#footnote833"><sup>[833]</sup></a>Pliny that
  the river Tigris, being stopped in its course by the mountains of Taurus,
  loses itself under ground, and rises again on the other side at Nymphæum.
  According to Marcellinus, it seems to be at Nymphæum that it sinks into
  the earth. Be it as it may, this, he tells us, is the place where that
  fiery matter called naptha issued: from whence, undoubtedly, the place
  had its name. <a name="footnotetag834"
  href="#footnote834"><sup>[834]</sup></a>Bitumen nascitur prope lacum
  Sosingitem, cujus alveo Tigris voratus, fluensque subterraneus, procursis
  spatiis longis, emergit. Hic et Naptha gignitur specie piceâ. In his
  pagis hiatus conspicitur terræ, unde halitus lethalis exsurgens,
  quodcunque animal prope consistit, odore gravi consumit. There was an
  island of the like nature at the mouth of the river Indus, which was
  sacred to the Sun, and styled Cubile <a name="footnotetag835"
  href="#footnote835"><sup>[835]</sup></a>Nympharum: in quâ nullum non

  and near it a fountain of fire, which consumed things brought near to it.
  Hard by Apollonia was an eruption of bituminous matter, like that in
  Assyria: and this too was named <a name="footnotetag837"
  href="#footnote837"><sup>[837]</sup></a>Nymphæum. The same author
  (Strabo) mentions, that in Seleucia, styled Pieria, there was alike

  The hot streams, and poisonous effluvia near Puteoli and lake Avernus are
  well known. It was esteemed a place of great sanctity; and people of a
  prophetic character are said to have here resided. Here was a <a
  name="footnotetag839" href="#footnote839"><sup>[839]</sup></a>Nymphæum,
  supposed to have been an oracular temple. There was a method of
  divination at Rome, mentioned by <a name="footnotetag840"
  href="#footnote840"><sup>[840]</sup></a>Dion Cassius, in which people
  formed their judgment of future events from the steam of lighted
  frankincense. The terms of inquiry were remarkable: for their curiosity
  was indulged in respect to every future contingency, excepting death and
  marriage. The place of divination was here too called <a

  from Ain Ompha came Nympha; so from Al Ompha was derived Lympha. This
  differed from Aqua, or common water, as being of a sacred and prophetic

  divination; and they were in consequence of it styled
  <i>Lymphati</i>.</p>

  <p>From what has preceded, we may perceive that there once existed a
  wonderful resemblance in the rites, customs, and terms of worship, among
  nations widely separated. Of this, as I proceed, many instances will be
  continually produced. I have already mentioned that this similitude in
  terms, and the religious system, which was so widely propagated, were
  owing to one great family, who spread themselves almost universally.
  Their colonies went abroad under the sanction and direction of their
  priests; and carried with them both the rites and the records of their
  country. Celsus took notice of this; and thought that people payed too
  little attention to memorials of this nature. He mentions particularly
  the oracular temples at Dodona, at Delphi, at Claros, with those of the
  Branchidæ and Amonians: at the same time passing over many other places,
  from whose priests and votaries the whole earth seemed to have been
  peopled<a name="footnotetag844" href="#footnote844"><sup>[844]</sup></a>.

<h3>PATOR AND PATRA.</h3>

  <p>I cannot help thinking that the word <span title="patêr" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;</span>, pater, when used in the
  religious addresses of the Greeks and Romans, meant not, as is supposed,
  a father, or parent; but related to the divine influence of the Deity,
  called, by the people of the east, Pator, as I have <a
  name="footnotetag850" href="#footnote850"><sup>[850]</sup></a>shewn. From
  hence I should infer, that two words, originally very distinct, have been
  rendered one and the <a name="footnotetag851"
  href="#footnote851"><sup>[851]</sup></a>same. The word pater, in the
  common acceptation, might be applicable to Saturn; for he was supposed to
  have been the father of all the Gods, and was therefore so entitled by
  the antient poet Sulpitius.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag852" href="#footnote852"><sup>[852]</sup></a>Jane pater, Jane tuens, Dive biceps, biformis,</p>
      <p>O! cate rerum sator; O! principium Deorum.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But, when it became a title, which was bestowed upon Gods of every
  denomination, it made Jupiter animadvert with some warmth upon the
  impropriety, if we may credit Lucilius:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag853" href="#footnote853"><sup>[853]</sup></a>Ut nemo sit nostrum, quin pater optimus Divôm est:</p>
      <p>Ut Neptunus pater, Liber, Saturnus pater, Mars,</p>
      <p>Janus, Quirinus, pater, omnes dicamur ad unum.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And not only the Gods, but the Hierophantæ, in most temples; and those
  priests, in particular, who were occupied in the celebration of
  mysteries, were styled Patres: so that it was undoubtedly a religious
  term imported from Egypt, the same as Pator, and Patora, before
  mentioned. I have taken notice, that the Pateræ of Curtius were the
  priests of Hamon: but that writer was unacquainted with the true meaning
  of the word, as well as with the pronunciation, which seems to have been
  penultimâ productâ. The worship of Ham, or the Sun, as it was the most
  antient, so it was the most universal, of any in the world. It was at
  first the prevailing religion of Greece, and was propagated over all the
  sea coast of Europe; whence it extended itself into the inland provinces.
  It was established in Gaul and Britain; and was the original religion of
  this island, which the Druids in aftertimes adopted. That it went high in
  the north is evident from Ausonius, who takes notice of its existing in
  his time. He had relations, who were priests of this order and
  denomination; and who are, on that account, complimented by him, in his
  ode to Attius Patera <a name="footnotetag854"

  <p>The true name of the Amonian priests I have shewn to have been Petor,
  or Pator; and the instrument which they held in their hands was styled
  Petaurum. They used to dance round a large fire, in honour of the Sun,
  whose orbit they affected to describe. At the same time they exhibited
  other feats of activity, to amuse the votaries who resorted to their
  temples. This dance was sometimes performed in armour, especially in
  Crete: and, being called Pyrrhic, was supposed to have been so named from
  Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles. But, when was he in Crete? Besides, it is
  said to have been practised by the Argonautic heroes before his time. It
  was a religious dance, denominated from fire, with which it was
  accompanied.</p>

  Betarmus, was a name given to the dance, from the temple of the Deity
  where it was probably first practised. It is a compound of Bet Armes, or
  Armon, called, more properly, Hermes, and Hermon. Bet, and Beth, among
  the Amonians, denoted a temple. There is reason to think that the
  circular dances of the Dervises, all over the east, are remains of these
  antient customs. In the first ages this exercise was esteemed a religious
  rite, and performed by people of the temple where it was exhibited: but,
  in aftertimes, the same feats were imitated by rope-dancers and vagrants,
  called Petauristæ, and Petauristarii; who made use of a kind of pole,
  styled petaurum.&mdash;Of these the Roman writers make frequent mention;
  and their feats are alluded to by Juvenal:</p>

  <p>Manilius likewise gives an account of this people, and their activity;
  wherein may be observed some remains of the original institution:</p>

  <p>I have shewn, that the Pateræ, or Priests, were so denominated from
  the Deity styled Pator; whose shrines were named Patera, and Petora. They
  were oracular temples of the Sun; which in aftertimes were called Petra,
  and ascribed to other Gods. Many of them for the sake of mariners were
  erected upon rocks, and eminences near the sea: hence the term <span
  title="petra" class="grk">&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>,
  petra, came at length to signify any rock or stone, and to be in a manner
  confined to that meaning. But in the first ages it was ever taken in a
  religious sense; and related to the shrines of Osiris, or the Sun, and to
  the oracles, which were supposed to be there exhibited. Thus Olympus near
  Pisa, though no rock, but a huge mound, or hill (<a name="footnotetag862"
  href="#footnote862"><sup>[862]</sup></a><span title="Peri gar ton Kronion LOPHON agetai ta Olumpia" class="grk"

  termed Petra, as relating to oracular influence. Hence Pindar, speaking
  of Iämus, who was supposed to have been conducted by Apollo to Olympia,
  says, <i>that they both came to the Petra Elibatos upon the lofty Cronian
  mount: there Apollo bestowed upon Iämus a double portion of prophetic

  >&#x397;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  Elibatos, was a favourite term with Homer, and other poets; and is
  uniformly joined with Petra. They do not seem to have known the purport
  of it; yet they adhere to it religiously, and introduce it wherever they
  have an opportunity. <span title="Êlibatos" class="grk"

  was the name of the temple, and specified the Deity there worshipped. In
  like manner the word Petra had in great measure lost its meaning; yet it
  is wonderful to observe how industriously it is introduced by writers,
  when they speak of sacred and oracular places. Lycophron calls the temple

  <p>I have shewn that people of old made use of caverns for places of
  worship: hence this at Athens had the name of Petra, or temple. <a
  name="footnotetag869" href="#footnote869"><sup>[869]</sup></a>It is said
  of Ceres, that after she had wandered over the whole earth, she at last
  reposed herself upon a stone at Eleusis. They in like manner at Delphi
  shewed the petra, upon which the Sibyl Herophile at her first arrival sat
  <a name="footnotetag870" href="#footnote870"><sup>[870]</sup></a>down. In
  short, there is in history of every oracular temple some legend about a
  stone; some reference to the word Petra. To clear this up, it is
  necessary to observe, that when the worship of the Sun was almost
  universal, this was one name of that Deity even among the Greeks. They
  called him Petor, and Petros; and his temple was styled Petra. This they
  oftentimes changed to <span title="lithos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; so little did they
  understand their own mythology. There were however some writers, who
  mentioned it as the name of the Sun, and were not totally ignorant of its
  meaning. This we may learn from the Scholiast upon Pindar. <a

  <p>If then the name of the Sun, and of his temples, was among the antient
  Grecians Petros, and Petra; we may easily account for that word so often
  occurring in the accounts of his worship. The Scholia above will moreover
  lead us to discover whence the strange notion arose about the famous
  Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ; who is said to have prophesied, that a stone
  would fall from the Sun. All that he had averred, may be seen in the
  relation of the Scholiast above: which amounts only to this, that Petros
  was a name of the Sun. It was a word of Egyptian original, derived from
  Petor, the same as Ham, the Iämus of the antient Greeks. This Petros some
  of his countrymen understood in a different sense; and gave out, that he
  had foretold a stone would drop from the Sun. Some were idle enough to
  think that it was accomplished: and in consequence of it pretended to
  shew at Ægospotamos the very <a name="footnotetag873"
  href="#footnote873"><sup>[873]</sup></a>stone, which was said to have
  fallen. The like story was told of a stone at Abydus upon the Hellespont:
  and Anaxagoras was here too supposed to have been the prophet<a
  name="footnotetag874" href="#footnote874"><sup>[874]</sup></a>. In Abydi
  gymnasio ex eâ causâ colitur hodieque modicus quidem (lapis), sed quem in
  medio terrarum casurum Anaxagoras prædixisse narratur. The temples, or
  Petra here mentioned, were Omphalian, or Oracular: hence they were by a
  common mistake supposed to have been in the centre of the habitable
  globe. They were also <span title="Êlibatoi Petrai" class="grk"

  Greeks derived from <span title="bainô" class="grk"
  >&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;</span> descendo; and on this account
  the Petra were thought to have fallen from the <a name="footnotetag875"

  the mysterious story of Tantalus; and account for the punishment which he

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">The unhappy Tantalus<br />
From a satiety of bliss<br />

He was doom'd to sit under a huge stone,<br />
Which the father of the Gods<br />

Thus he sat<br />
In continual dread of its downfal,<br />
And lost to every comfort.</p>

  <p>It is said of Tantalus by some, that he was set up to his chin in
  water, with every kind of fruit within reach: yet hungry as he was and
  thirsty, he could never attain to what he wanted; every thing which he
  caught at eluding his efforts. But from the account given above by <a

  The mysteries which he revealed, were those of Osiris, the Sun: the
  Petor, and Petora of Egypt. He never afterwards could behold the Sun in
  its meridian, but it put him in mind of his crime: and he was afraid that
  the vengeance of the God would overwhelm him. This Deity, the Petor, and
  Petora of the Amonians, being by the later Greeks expressed Petros, and
  Petra, gave rise to the fable above about the stone of Tantalus. To this
  solution the same Scholiast upon Pindar bears witness, by informing us,
  <a name="footnotetag881" href="#footnote881"><sup>[881]</sup></a>that the

  <p>By laying all these circumstances together, and comparing them, we
  may, I think, not only find out wherein the mistake consisted, but
  likewise explain the grounds from whence the mistake arose. And this clue
  may lead us to the detection of other fallacies, and those of greater
  consequence. We may hence learn the reason, why so many Deities were
  styled <span title="Petraioi" class="grk"

  same worship seems to have prevailed, in some degree, in the west; as we
  may judge from an antient inscription at Milan, which was dedicated<a
  name="footnotetag884" href="#footnote884"><sup>[884]</sup></a> Herculi in
  Petrâ. But all Deities were not so worshipped: and the very name Petra
  was no other than the sacred term Petora, given to a cavern, as being
  esteemed in the first ages an oracular temple. And some reverence to
  places of this sort was kept up a long time. We may from hence understand
  the reason of the prohibition given to some of the early proselytes to
  Christianity, that they should no more<a name="footnotetag885"
  href="#footnote885"><sup>[885]</sup></a> ad petras vota reddere: and by
  the same light we may possibly explain that passage in Homer, where he
  speaks of persons entering into compacts under oaks, and rocks, as places
  of<a name="footnotetag886" href="#footnote886"><sup>[886]</sup></a>
  security. The oak was sacred to Zeus, and called Sar-On: and Petra in its
  original sense being a temple, must be looked upon as an asylum. But this
  term was not confined to a rock or cavern: every oracular temple was
  styled Petra, and Petora. Hence it proceeded that so many Gods were
  called <span title="Theoi Petraioi" class="grk"

  thing of course, and to be taken for granted, unless there be particular
  evidence to the contrary. His vows were made to Mithras, who was styled
  by the nations in the east Pator; his temples were Patra, and Petra, and
  his festivals Patrica. Nonnus gives a proper account of the Petra, when
  he represents it as Omphean, or oracular:</p>

  <p>The offerings, which people in antient times used to present to the
  Gods, were generally purchased at the entrance of the temple; especially
  every species of consecrated bread, which was denominated accordingly. If
  it was an oracular temple of Alphi, the loaves and cakes were styled <a
  name="footnotetag894" href="#footnote894"><sup>[894]</sup></a>Alphita. If
  it was expressed Ampi, or Ompi, the cakes were Ompai<a

  Ham-orus had the name of <a name="footnotetag897"

  Those sacred to Peon, the God of light, were called <a

  Cha-on, which signifies the house of the Sun, <a name="footnotetag899"

  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>. From Pur-Ham,

  href="#footnote900"><sup>[900]</sup></a><span title="Puramoun" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;</span>. From
  Ob-El, Pytho Deus, came <a name="footnotetag901"
  href="#footnote901"><sup>[901]</sup></a>Obelia. If the place were a Petra

  >&#x3A0;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, Pitura. One of the
  titles of the Sun was El-Aphas, Sol Deus ignis. This El-aphas the Greeks
  rendered Elaphos, <span title="elaphos" class="grk"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; and supposed it to
  relate to a deer: and the title El-Apha-Baal, given by the Amonians to
  the chief Deity, was changed to <span title="elaphêbolos" class="grk"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3B7;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  a term of a quite different purport. El-aphas, and El-apha-baal, related
  to the God Osiris, the Deity of light: and there were sacred liba made at
  his temple, similar to those above, and denominated from him <span
  title="Elaphoi" class="grk"
  >&#x395;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, Elaphoi. In Athenæus

  <p>One species of sacred bread, which used to be offered to the Gods, was
  of great antiquity, and called Boun. The Greeks, who changed the Nu final
  into a Sigma, expressed it in the nominative, <span title="bous" class="grk"
  >&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>; but, in the accusative, more truly
  boun, <span title="boun" class="grk">&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;</span>.
  Hesychius speaks of the Boun, and describes it, <span title="eidos pemmatos kerata echontos" class="grk"

  after the same manner: <span title="boun, eidos pemmatos kerata echontos" class="grk"

  &#x3B5;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; <i>a sort of
  cake with horns</i>. Diogenes Laertius, speaking of the same offering
  being made by Empedocles, describes the chief ingredients of which it was
  composed: <a name="footnotetag904"

  takes notice of this kind of offering, when he is speaking of the Jewish
  women at Pathros in Egypt, and of their base idolatry; in all which their
  husbands had encouraged them. The women, in their expostulation upon his
  rebuke, tell him: <i>Since we left off to burn incense to the Queen of

  <p>I have mentioned that they were sometimes called Petora, and by the
  Greeks Pitura. This, probably, was the name of those liba, or cakes,
  which the young virgins of Babylonia and Persis, used to offer at the
  shrine of their God, when they were to be first prostituted: for, all,
  before marriage, were obliged to yield themselves up to some stranger to
  be deflowered. It was the custom for all the young women, when they
  arrived towards maturity, to sit in the avenue of the temple, with a
  girdle, or rope, round their middle; and whatever passenger laid hold of
  it was entitled to lead them away. This practice is taken notice of, as
  subsisting among the Babylonians, in the epistle ascribed to the prophet
  Jeremiah; which he is supposed to have written to Baruch. v. 43. <span

  <p>The Patrica were not only rites of Mithras, but also of Osiris, who
  was in reality the same Deity.</p>

  <p>We have a curious inscription to this purpose, and a representation,
  which was first exhibited by the learned John Price in his observations
  upon Apuleius. It is copied from an original, which he saw at Venice: and
  there is an engraving from it in the Edition of Herodotus by <a
  name="footnotetag911" href="#footnote911"><sup>[911]</sup></a>Gronovius,
  as well as in that by <a name="footnotetag912"
  href="#footnote912"><sup>[912]</sup></a>Wesselinge: but about the purport
  of it they are strangely mistaken. They suppose it to relate to a
  daughter of Mycerinus, the son of Cheops. She died, it seems: and her
  father was so affected with her death, that he made a bull of wood, which
  he gilt, and in it interred his daughter. Herodotus says, that he saw the
  bull of Mycerinus; and that it alluded to this history. But,
  notwithstanding the authority of this great author, we may be assured
  that it was an emblematical representation, and an image of the sacred
  bull Apis and Mneuis. And, in respect to the sculpture above mentioned,
  and the characters therein expressed, the whole is a religious ceremony,
  and relates to an event of great antiquity, which was commemorated in the
  rites of Osiris. Of this I shall treat hereafter: at present, it is
  sufficient to observe, that the sacred process is carried on before a
  temple; on which is a Greek inscription, but in the provincial
  characters: <span title="Endon Patrikên Heortên Pherô" class="grk"

  funeral? It denotes a festival in honour of the Sun, who was styled, as I
  have shewn, Pator; and his temple was called Patra: whence these rites
  were denominated Patrica. Plutarch alludes to this Egyptian ceremony, and
  supposes it to relate to Isis, and to her mourning for the loss of her
  son. Speaking of the month Athyr, he mentions <a name="footnotetag913"

  <i>The Egyptians have a custom in the month Athyr of ornamenting a golden
  image of a bull; which they cover with a black robe of the finest linen.
  This they do in commemoration of Isis, and her grief for the loss of
  Orus</i>. In every figure, as they are represented in the sculpture,
  there appears deep silence and reverential awe: but nothing that betrays
  any sorrow in the agents. They may commemorate the grief of Isis; but
  they certainly do not allude to any misfortune of their own: nor is there
  any thing the least funereal in the process. The Egyptians of all nations
  were the most extravagant in their <a name="footnotetag914"
  href="#footnote914"><sup>[914]</sup></a>grief. If any died in a family of
  consequence, the women used by way of shewing their concern to soil their
  heads with the mud of the river; and to disfigure their faces with filth.
  In this manner they would run up and down the streets half naked,
  whipping themselves as they ran: and the men likewise whipped themselves.
  They cut off their hair upon the death of a dog; and shaved their
  eyebrows for a dead cat. We may therefore judge, that some very strong
  symptoms of grief would have been expressed, had this picture any way
  related to the sepulture of a king's daughter. Herodotus had his account
  from different people: one half he confessedly <a name="footnotetag915"
  href="#footnote915"><sup>[915]</sup></a>disbelieved; and the remainder
  was equally incredible. For no king of Egypt, if he had made a
  representation of the sacred <a name="footnotetag916"
  href="#footnote916"><sup>[916]</sup></a>bull, durst have prostituted it
  for a tomb: and, as I have before said, <span title="Heortê Patrikê" class="grk"

<h4>AN</h4>

<h3>ACCOUNT</h3>

<h4>OF THE</h4>

<h2>GODS OF GREECE;</h2>

<h3><i>To shew that they were all originally one</i> GOD,<br />
<i>the</i> SUN.</h3>

  <p>As I shall have a great deal to say concerning the Grecian Theology in
  the course of this work, it will be necessary to take some previous
  notice of their Gods; both in respect to their original, and to their
  purport. Many learned men have been at infinite pains to class the
  particular Deities of different countries, and to point out which were
  the same. But they would have saved themselves much labour, if, before
  they had bewildered themselves in these fruitless inquiries, they had
  considered whether all the Deities of which they treat, were not
  originally the same: all from one source; branched out and diversified in
  different parts of the world. I have mentioned that the nations of the
  east acknowledged originally but one Deity, the Sun: but when they came
  to give the titles of Orus, Osiris, and Cham, to some of the heads of
  their family; they too in time were looked up to as Gods, and severally
  worshipped as the Sun. This was practised by the Egyptians: but this
  nation being much addicted to refinement in their worship, made many
  subtile distinctions: and supposing that there were certain emanations of
  divinity, they affected to particularize each by some title; and to
  worship the Deity by his attributes. This gave rise to a multiplicity of
  Gods: for the more curious they were in their disquisitions, the greater
  was the number of these substitutes. Many of them at first were designed
  for mere titles: others, as I before mentioned, were <span
  title="aporrhoiai" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x1FE4;&#x1FE5;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>,
  derivatives, and emanations: all which in time were esteemed distinct
  beings, and gave rise to a most inconsistent system of Polytheism. The
  Grecians, who received their religion from Egypt and the east,
  misconstrued every thing which was imported; and added to these
  absurdities largely. They adopted Deities, to whose pretended attributes
  they were totally strangers; whose names they could not articulate, or
  spell. They did not know how to arrange the elements, of which the words
  were composed. Hence it was, that Solon the Wise could not escape the
  bitter, but just censure of the priest in Egypt, who accused both him,
  and the Grecians in general, of the grossest puerility and ignorance. <a

  This blindness in regard to their own theology, and to that of the
  countries, whence they borrowed, led them to misapply the terms, which
  they had received, and to make a God out of every title. But however they
  may have separated, and distinguished them under different personages,
  they are all plainly resolvable into one Deity, the Sun. The same is to
  be observed in the Gods of the Romans. This may in great measure be
  proved from the current accounts of their own writers; if we attend a
  little closely to what they say: but it will appear more manifest from
  those who had been in Egypt, and copied their accounts from that country.
  There are few characters, which at first sight appear more distinct than
  those of Apollo and Bacchus. Yet the department, which is generally
  appropriated to Apollo, as the Sun, I mean the conduct of the year, is by
  Virgil given to Bacchus, or Liber. He joins him with Ceres, and calls
  them both the bright luminaries of the world.</p>

  <p>It was therefore idle in the antients to make a disquisition about the
  identity of any God, as compared with another; and to adjudge him to
  Jupiter rather than to Mars, to Venus rather than Diana. <a

  <i>Some</i>, says Diodorus, <i>think that Osiris is Serapis; others that
  he is Dionusus; others still, that he is Pluto: many take him for Zeus,
  or Jupiter, and not a few for Pan</i>. This was an unnecessary
  embarrassment: for they were all titles of the same God, there being
  originally by no means that diversity which is imagined, as Sir John
  Marsham has very justly observed. <a name="footnotetag928"

  It is said, above, that Osiris was by some thought to be Jupiter, and by
  others to be Pluto. But Pluto, among the best theologists, was esteemed
  the same as Jupiter; and indeed the same as Proserpine, Ceres, Hermes,
  Apollo, and every other Deity.</p>

  <p>There were to be sure a number of strange attributes, which by some of
  the poets were delegated to different personages; but there were other
  writers who went deeper in their researches, and made them all centre in
  one. They sometimes represented this sovereign Deity as Dionusus; who,
  according to Ausonius, was worshipped in various parts under different
  titles, and comprehended all the Gods under one character.</p>

  <p>Poseidon, God of the sea, was also reputed the chief God, the Deity of
  Fire. This we may infer from his priest. He was styled a Purcon, and
  denominated from him, and served in his oracular temples; as we learn
  from Pausanias, who says, <a name="footnotetag933"

  P'urcon is Ignis vel lucis dominus: and we may know the department of the
  God from the name of the priest. He was no other than the supreme Deity,
  the Sun: from whom all were supposed to be derived. Hence Poseidon or
  Neptune, in the Orphic verses, is, like Zeus, styled the father of Gods
  and men.</p>

  <p>As we have seen how the father of the Gods was diversified, it may be
  worth while to hear what the supposed mother of all the Deities says of
  her titles and departments, in Apuleius. <a name="footnotetag948"
  href="#footnote948"><sup>[948]</sup></a>Me primigenii Phryges
  Pessinuntiam nominant Deûm Matrem: hinc Autochthones Attici Cecropiam
  Minervam: illinc fluctuantes Cyprii Paphiam Venerem: Cretes sagittiferi

  <p>Porphyry acknowledged, that Vesta, Rhea, Ceres, Themis, Priapus,
  Proserpina, Bacchus, Attis, Adonis, Silenus, and the Satyrs, were all
  one, and the<a name="footnotetag949"
  href="#footnote949"><sup>[949]</sup></a> same. Nobody had examined the
  theology of the antients more deeply than Porphyry. He was a determined
  Pagan, and his evidence in this point is unexceptionable. The titles of
  Orus and Osiris being given to Dionusus, caused him in time to partake of
  the same worship which was paid to the great luminary; and as he had also
  many other titles, from them sprung a multiplicity of Deities. <a

  names or titles, they all, in respect to worship, relate ultimately to
  the Sun. <a name="footnotetag951"

  metathesis for Phar-Tor, from Phur, ignis. So Prætor and Prætorium are
  from Pur-tor of the same purport. The general name for all of them was
  Purgoi, still with a reference to fire.</p>

  omitted his name, and transferred the history to Elis. But all the
  antient editions mention Achor of Cyrene; <i>Cyrenaici Achorem Deum,
  &amp;c</i>. I have examined those printed at Rome, 1470, 1473. those of
  Venice, 1472, 1476, 1487, 1507, 1510. those of Parma, 1476, 1479, 1481.
  one at Brescia, 1496. the editions at Paris, 1516, 1524, 1532. the Basil
  edition by Froben, 1523: and they all have this reading. The edition also
  by Johannes Spira, 1469, has Acorem, but with some variation. The
  spurious reading, <i>Elei myagrum Deum</i>, was, I imagine, first
  admitted into the text by Sigismund Gelenius, who was misled by the
  similarity of the two histories. Harduin has followed him blindly,
  without taking any notice of the more antient and true reading.</p>

  <p>Kircher says, that Pi in the Coptic is a prefix, by which a noun is
  known to be masculine, and of the singular number: and that Pa is a
  pronoun possessive. Paromi is Vir meus. It may be so in the Coptic: but
  in antient times Pi, Pa, Phi, were only variations of the same article:
  and were indifferently put before all names: of which I have given many
  instances. See Prodromus. Copt. p. 303.</p>

  Io Inachi filia nupsit ei? How could Io be married to him when she was to
  him in degree of ascent, as far off as his grandmother's great

  the time of Hipparchus, about the 63d Olympiad, yet some writers make him
  three, some four, some five hundred years before that æra. It is scarce
  possible that he should have been so unknown to them if they had been

  <p><a name="footnote592" href="#footnotetag592">[592]</a> Go-zan is the
  place, or temple, of the Sun. I once thought that Goshen, or, as it is
  sometimes expressed, Gozan, was the same as Cushan: but I was certainly
  mistaken. The district of Goshen was indeed the nome of Cushan; but the
  two words are not of the same purport. Goshen is the same as Go-shan, and
  Go-zan, analogous to Beth-shan, and signifies the place of the Sun.
  Go-shen, Go-shan, Go-zan, and Gau-zan, are all variations of the same
  name. In respect to On, there were two cities so called. The one was in
  Egypt, where Poti-phera was Priest. Genesis. c. 41. v. 45. The other

  Liber de animâ. On which account these writers are blamed by the learned
  Valesius. They are, however, guilty of no mistake; only use the word out
  of composition. Ain-Aptha, contracted Naptha, was properly the fountain

  Ptha. It was one of the titles of the God of fire, called Apha-Astus, the
  Hephastus of the Greeks; to whom this inflammable substance was
  sacred.</p>

  account for so many places in the east being styled Petra. Persis and
  India did not abound with rocks more than Europe; yet, in these parts, as

  Petra: such as <span title="Petra Sisimithrou" class="grk"

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
